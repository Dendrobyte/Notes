# Puzzle Games

Lecturer: Eric Zimmerman

Some say the earliest known puzzle/riddle in human history is the Sphinx' riddle.

"A puzzle is an activity that's fun and has a right answer" -Scott Kim (Bejeweled 2, Heaven and Earth, Obsidian). We will be using this as our working definition for the lecture, looking at

1. A puzzle is "fun" - but how is it fun?
2. A puzzle has a right answer, not one right answer: at least one.

## Key Concepts

- **Defining puzzles.** A puzzle is a kind of game with one or more right answers. Puzzles can play with language, space, numbers, probability, physics, culture.
- **The experience of a puzzle.** The "fun" of a puzzle is sometimes about a meditative state, sometimes about a sudden insight. And sometimes both.
- **Puzzles and deep mysteries.** Puzzles are linked to religion, meditation, and diviniation - and they do interesting things to our brains.
- **The paradox of puzzle authorship.** Puzzles ca be about figuring out what the sdeigner intended and nothing more. But they can also be about the opposite: understanding hte complexity of emergent, procedural systems.
- **Puzzles inside games.** There are many ways [SEE SLIDES]

The labryinth, also know as the "7-circuit labyrinth" or "classical labyrinth". Considering it in terms of games, it doesn't strike one as a game right off the bat. We are still tinkering with elemental forms of human experience, still tapping into the deep mysteries of culture, human perception, etc.

Labyrinths have one path with no branches. You walk, turn, change perspective, but **eventually reach the center.** Mazes have branches where you can **take wrong turns and reach dead ends.** "Play" (labyrinths) vs "game" (maze)

After their popularity, word squares became a form of children's place. It is from these ideas that word puzzles were combined with riddles in newspapers, and thus the crossword was born (originally known as a "word-cross puzzle").

## Crosswords

Date: 1913  
Dev: Arthur Wynne  
Platform: Newspaper  
Origin: USA  

### Why Crosswords

They are the most widespread and enduring form of word-play, made in various languages and one of the most open ways people are exposed to riddles.

The symmetry used in crosswords is called **rotational symmetry.** The more black squares you add, the easier the puzzle gets. You don't want clumps of black squares or looking ugly, so you have some nice diagonal lines. They are also used to break up combinations of letters that are hards to make words out of.

There was some intense backlash to crosswords, insisting crosswords were not a game nor a sport.

Crosswords have also influenced a lot of vocabulary usage of words that were rarely known but in the dictionary. It changed the course of language.

## Sudoku, the Magic Number Square Puzzle

_Not_ a key game, but still spoken about. Developed in the 80s, but didn't take off until the 90s when a judge made a computer program generate puzzles for him. Becomes international hit in the mid 2000s

### Pentominoes

Every permutation of five squares, connected, fits together!

## Tetris

Date: 1984  
Dev: Alexey Pajitnov  
Platform: Electronika 60  
Origin: Soviet Union  

### Why Tetris

Originally owned by Soviet Union, but distributed by Sega as a bootlet version in 1987 and in the arcade in 1988. It was the most ported video game of all time and made handheld gaming viable.

The computer Pakitnov used was capable of procedural generation for endless puzzles. The new one Tetris does randomness is shuffles a bag of items first and queues them, versus queueing at random such that **you don't get more than 2 'L' pieces in a row.**

This game is also the source of the "Tetris Effect", entering a flow state/meditative state. This meditative state and pattern reminds us of the labyrinthian idea of one path.

### Probability Puzzles

We've seen a lot of games that mess with probability, such as the unpredictable shuffle in decks of cards; the first form of classic procedural generation (or it could be knucklebones).

Solitaire was originally looked down upon. It is a game of patience, playing by yourself.

## Microsoft Solitaire

Date: 1990  
Dev: Wes Cherry & Susan Kare w/ Microsoft  
Platform: PC  
Origin: USA  

### Why Solitaire

It is the comeback of the original single-player game that became one of the most-played games ever.

The game taught a generation to use a mouse, as well. Not many people know how to use a mouse since windows did not require one originally.

The game is also infamous as the first office "productivity killer". Wes Cherry hid a certain 'boss key', where your game would be replaced by a spreadsheet/productive looking screen. It conceals the true game being played.

## Lemmings

Date: 1991  
Dev: Dave Jones w/ DMA Design  
Platform: Amiga  
Origin: Scotland, UK  

### Why Lemmings

It is a puzzle game that could only be digital.

The lemmings that stop other lemmings from falling off a cliff eventually explode- they don't move on to the end.

The game is a puzzle as an entire process. Playing with the process is a key component that allows for different possibilities in the game.

The adorable characters are incredibly important so they are cared by the players, for example the walk cycle was made just right so the characters felt more protective over the Lemmings (caring more about them).

Lemmings was also the beginning of the physics puzzle. These games include _Artillery_, _Worms_, _The Incredible Machine_, _World of Goo_ and _Angry Birds_.

### Puzzle Games as a genre

Descendants of puzzle games start to appear with different colors, space usage, etc.

## Puzzle Bobble

Date: 1994  
Dev: Seiichi Nakakuki w/ Taito  
Platform: Arcade  
Origin: Japan  

### Why Puzzle Bobble

Another descendent of puzzle games, but with head-to-head competitive puzzling! It was one of the first two-player puzzle games/competitive puzzle games to play. There was direct interaction with your opponent, rewarding the winner.

Franchise characters from another genre also show up.

## Bejeweled

Date: 2001  
Dev: PopCap Games  
Platform: PC  
Origin: USA  

### Why Bejeweled

It's about time pressure but less about making mistakes and quickly finding matches and comibnations. Made match-three highly accessible and popular. This formula led to one of the most popular genres of puzzle games.

It was also at the start of the rise of digital distribution and "casual games", where download speeds/internet speeds would make it impossible to download 3D games. The original game was about 10 megabytes. Allowed indie studios to get games to a wider audience.

Properties of casual games are varied... they're on the slides if you want to see that.

## Purple Moon (Studio)

Date: 2001  
Dev: This is a studio, Brenda Laurel was the head of it.  
Platform: PC  
Origin: USA  

This studio made highly narrative games. The art was very different than anything you see from other games at that time.

This studio's titles grow from puzzles not being "proper games" or "women's games". Adventure games are a form of puzzle game, so these narrative puzzles try to do something that have not just one right answer but multiple.

### Puzzles in games - There are many ways to design

There are many ways to play puzzle games and ways to design the puzzles.

_The Witness_ is a game about puzzle design with **Maze and Graph Puzzles, Space-Division Puzzles,** and **Environmental Context Puzzles.**

## Portal

Date: 2007  
Dev: Valve  
Platform: PC, Xbox 360  
Origin: USA  

### Why Portal

It's a first-person shooter engine... but for puzzles! Portal figured out an interesting way to make jumping happen.

The possibilities of combinatorial puzzle design were very dense.

Also, this started off as a student team. It started as _Narbacular Drop (PC, 2005)_ by Nuclear Monkey Software.

There is an ah-ha moment and a good narrative process of getting from here to there. It is a well-designed process that gives moments of insights. It is a riddle and a shuffled deck; a maze and a labyrinth.
