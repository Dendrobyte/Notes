# Role-Playing Games - 11/4/19

## Key Concepts

- The origin of D&D and it songoing influence
- How role-playing games are a collision of simulation and narrative
- The complex interaction between player and character - between game and reality
- Differences between Japanese RPGs (JRPGS) versus "wester" RPGS (CRPGS)
- The tension between emergent vs. scripted elements of role-playing games

**Dave Arneson and Gary Gygax** were the two designers for Dungeons & Dragons

## RPG History: Precedents to D&D

- Tabletop miniature wargaming
- Chaturanga (aka chess)- "special characters" in games
- Kriegspiel- Tactical realism with a referee to roll dice and keep track
- Strategos (Charles TOtten)- 12-sided randomness, "try anything"
  - The referee wasn't there to maintain rules, but to manage players that can do virtually anything; a human processor for an infinite list of possibilities of choices
- Little Wars (H.G. Wells), Diplomacy (Calhammer)- War games at home
  - Lots of interaction between players, such as passing notes and whatnot

## Proto-RPG Culture

In the late 60s, those who wanted to play these types of games had hard times finding each other and would really only find each other through newsletters or one of the rare game conferences. _Gary Gygax_ had the first GenCon, which was essentially this type of event.

## RPG History: Immediate Precedents to D&D

- The Siege of Bodenburg, 1967- Zoom in to one miniature, it's one person
  - Unusual because normally one little soldier would represent an entire unit of soldiers
- Chainmail (Gary Gygax & Jeff Perren), 1967- Fantasy enters combat
  - Made several tables and such as a guiding set of rules alike to medieval combat
  - Had a little addition at the end that essentially defined classes; it was vary abnormal and entirely new (i.e. heroic character you would have to hit multiple times _which was the origin of the health bar idea_)
- The Braunstein game, 1967- Roleplaying becomes a game with rules
  - No one controlled armies, but each person was playing individual characters in a German town with war raging all around.
  - This game was the dawn of role-playing, at least specifically adults playing a game with roles and various rules
  - The dice with more than 6 sides came from a physics lab (geometric solids)
  - Dave Arneson brought about a large quandry by pretending he was a CIA agent in the game (lol)
- Blackmoor (Dave Arneson), Early 1970s- The fantasy campaign
  - Created a series of tunnels, catacombs, etc. in caves beneath the cities of blackmoors. At this point, the 'dungeon' was invented where you can find treasure and fight monsters as a team.
  - This idea led to leveling up, classes, etc.

The original Dungeons and Dragons game was a box of four books, and once it was sold and distributed, it caught on heavily.

## Dungeons & Dragons

Date: 1974  
Designers: Dave Arneson & Gary Gygax  
Platform: Tabletop  
Region of Origin: USA  

**THE** most influential game on modern videogames

- Players playing one character
- Hit points, armor, class, level
- Exploring, fighting, looting, level-up cycle
- Game rules as a simulation
- Rolling dice to resolve situations
- Game as a multi session campgaing
- Popularized fantasy narrative in games
- Players creating game narrative togehter
- Game expansions and licensing

The above is not all directly from D&D, but all came together from this one origin

It's made up of improvized creative storytelling and statistical emphasis on using dice. While there are infinite possibilities, the game still lies at the whim of RNG (not just the DM).

Dungeons & Dragons can be looked at as a simluation of reality- a simulation of a fantasy reality

Gerhard von Scharnhorst (On the Effects of Firearms), 1813. These tables were instrumental in choosing the statistics for things to hit enemies and whatnot. As with the early D&D damange table, they are **systems of simulation**.

The quote... "These rules may be treated as guide lines around which you form a game that suits you", "The secret we should never let the gamemasters know ist hat they don't need any rules". The rules are just there to guide you. In RPGs, you can break and bend the rules as long as everyone remains in tandem with each other to keep the story going. **Rule Zero:** The game master makes all the rules. _The dice still remain there for a reason_.

## D&D as Storytelling

Some books had a lot of influence on D&D, all featuring male heros fighting mystical creatures...

- 1954, Conan the Barbarian
- 1970, Swords and Deviltry
- 1972, Moorcock: Elric of Menibone
- 1954, J.R.R. Tolkien books- particularly the Lord of the Rings trilogy
  - These were even more influential than the others
  - The character types were _too_ closely influenced
- Norse/Greek mythology was also largely influential, such as centaurs, unicorns, dragons, etc.

- World has a history
- Game lasts many sessions
- Rich fantasy world
- Players take on a persona
- Use immersive voices to act
- They can do _anything_
- Dungeon Master improvises the story, and also the rules (with the guidance of the dice)

_Are you literally imagining you're an alternate world?_ No. It ruins the practicality of making decisions, and would remove an aspect of having certain fun, "I want to attack the darkness"

_Shared Fantasy_, (1983). A study on role-playing games. When you take part in an RPG you exist on 3 different levels.

1. You are acting as a player in a game (CHARACTER)
2. You are a real life person reaching for goals in the game (PLAYER)
3. You are a person who has an identity outside of the game (PERSON)

### Player Types in RPGs

- Power gamer
- ... rip

~See D&D Legacy slides for the specific games and whatnot that were related to the things that game after D&D. This includes various books, other games, and LARPing. This also extends to indie RPGs and story games, where creators could connect over the internet and share things with each other.

One of these biggest influences D&D had was on digital adventure games, such as the characters and items discovered throughout the games.

## Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord

Date: 1981  
Designers: Andrew Greenberg and Robert Woodhead, w/ Sir-Tech Software  
Platform: PC  
Origin: USA  

Established the computer "dungeon crawl" RPG

- Classic elements: adventuring party, balancing diff classes and powers
- Wandering through a simulated 3D space
- one more
- and there was another one

Despite there are so many similarities between tabletop games and digital RPG games, the games were not improvised and the group/social aspect more or less disappeared.

The games have a specific flow. Adventure --> Level Up --> Recuperate --> Adventure... etc. The loop was first discovered in Blackmoore.

## NetHack

Date: 1987  
Designers: Mike Stephenson  
Platform: PC  
Origin: USA  

The most importante ROGUElike game

- Massively varied dungeon crawl
- Prime example of EMERGENCE
- Deep and complex despite its graphics
- Testament to opens-source development
- Costant unexpected situations

Roguelike games are pretty specific

- Procedurally generated spaces
- Turn-based
- Permadeath
- Combinatorial complexity

Procedurality in NetHack

Holy... WOW! I am seriously not paying attention.

NetHack takes away a reliance on graphics. You are purely focusing on the symbolic meanings of characters and what you are reading. The beauty of it is that you imagine so much. See the slides for the games that use these procedural examples (spelunky, dwarf fortress, ftl, minecraft)

## Ultima (Series)

Date: 1981-1999  
Designers: Richard Garriot w/ Origin Systems  
Platform: PC  
Origin: USA  

Thoughtful, influential singleplayer RPGs and MOOG

- Influential Designer
- Ethics-based character system
- Multi-title series spanning decades
- Generally, rich gameplay and deep worlds to explore
- Embodies toe "classic" CRPG

It allows you to walk outside of towns and explore the actual world (U3). The later game (U4) had you answer a personality quiz to choose what your character stats would be, pushing you toward one class. Ultimate later introduced 8 different axes on a virtues system. Ultima also evolved with the times, keeping up with graphics and such, and there were several spinoffs.

## Final Fantasy (Series)

Date: 1987 - Present  
Designers: Hironobu Sakaguchi w/ SquareSoft  
Platform: Famicom (NES)  
Origin: Japan  

Prototypical JRPG

- "Casual" approach to RPGs
- Also deep and richly customizable
- Pop culture sensibility
- Grinding as a core mechanic
- Attempt to bring emotional storytelling to games
- Took Japanese games to a global audience

Dragon Quest was the origin point for JRPGs (Chunsoft, 1986), and there are commonalities from Ultima and almost seems like a bridge from Wizardry to Ultima to Final Fantasy. It actually came about from a guy who wanted to create a more accessible type of RPG game

Final Fantasy important because of the amount of storytelling and the overall feeling of the games. You are exploring a huge world combining fantasy and science fiction, and then you're working to gather together a team of allis to save a world in crisis.

Final Fantasy is really well known for _grinding_. This tradition originated in Dragon Quest, and Final Fantasy just continued it. The idea of this grinding is controversial; is it sucking up someone's free time or does it have a purpose.

## Fallout

Date: 1997  
Designers: Tim Cain w/ InterPlay  
Platform: PC  
Origin: USA  

Smart and elegant CRPG ("Computer RPG"); america rgps

- Dark and ironic sense of style
- Political messages in its post-apocalyptic setting
- Room for player expression
- Attempts to balance procedurally and scripted/linear game design

Carries over the same statistics and such from D&D, but has some extra ones. THere is also turn-based combat, and a varying line of sight and distance between those types of things. It takes place in a large world with various locations and tasks. Fallout is one of the first CRPGs that gives the player dialogue choices they can use to express themselves differently which leads to different types of outcomes.

See JRPG vs. CRPG on the slides.

## Pokemon (Series)

Date: 1996 - Present  
Designers: Satoshi Tajiri w/ Game Freak  
Platform: Gameboy  
Origin: Japan  

The canonical creature-collecting game

- Adventure game and modular battles
- Encyclopedic system of creatures
- Game-centric transmedia of propery
- One other one...

The game is almost more about existing acorss multiple media platforms (tv show, card games, etc.) than it is just a game. Huge transmedia properties don't just come from books, comics, pictures, etc. Some just come from games! Pokemon as a transmedia property is _very_ gamecentric, essentially- the tv series practically exists to advertise everything else.

Pokemon really covers each of those original 3 aspects from earlier, i.e. Pokemon Go, in terms of bringing Pokemon into the real world.

And now... we have MMORPGS. These games bring us away from the real world and into the vast virtual world. The first thing to consider about these games is that there are _LOTS_ of players, and also the world has a presistent state. Lots of people will still be doing things while you are gone.

## World of Warcraft

Date: 2004  
Designers: Blizzard Entertainment  
Platform: PC  
Origin: USA  

Gold standard for the modern MMORPG

- Stylized but lush art direction (for its time, lots of polish)
- Lots of attention to the beginner and to the single-player experience
- Many community features like guilds
- Open-source game client
- Substantial "elder game" for advanced players
- Comple economy with integerated virtual item acution house

We see that we have returned to one character playing one character again. There are then different classes these players can embody. The holy trinity of MMO combat includes _DPS_, _Tank_, and _Healer_.

PvP started in a game called Everquest, and then a more popular setting called PVE. Warcraft added the roleplaying world which gained even more popularity. Returns to the idea of someone playing the role of a PERSON, PLAYER, and CHARACTER. Are we fictional characters, or is it just a different portrait of ourselves?
