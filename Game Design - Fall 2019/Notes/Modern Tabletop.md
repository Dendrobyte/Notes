## Key Concepts

- Playing cards are the best platform in the world
- 20th century muttae from auteur to folk to autuer to folk...
- All you need is one perfect idea (but people might only remember the idea)
- Competition, cooperation, allience, betrayal, multiplayer solitaire
- Material conditions affect invention-collectible card games, legacy games
- Boargames make a comeback via Europe (especially Germany)
- Digital games with physical metaphors- best of both worlds?

## Playing Cards

The greatest game platform on earth. Played in every part of society, seen in a huge variety of timelines.

The origin of playing cards is murky- thought to be made in China, perhaps as betting game. May be related to domino tiles that showed up in many languages.

We see card games having different size is a significant and defining feature of them.

Card games made it into Europe around the 1300s. The deck we are most familiar with _called the French deck_ was formalized in France around 1480. There are a huge variety of other types of cards (i.e. Swiss deck, German deck, etc.)

Cards were relatively cheap, but they were sent to factories to be cleaned. The backs are made to hide scuffs and such. Before the 1800s, information in the top left of the card were put on cards. This makes it easier because cards then have decks with more than 7 cards.

The key to playing cards is 2 things:

- Same on one side, different on the other
  - An identical wall of secrets. A game of imperfect information (_Fog of War!_)
- It's a grid of chunkable information. You can break it up in a variety of ways.
  - E.g. Ace can be low, ace can be high. Order by number, order by suites, etc.

"So long as anyone is left to wield a card.... nothing if not the ultimate game of 'imperfect information'" - _David Parlett_

## Contract Brige

Date: 1925  
Developer: Harold Vanderbilt  
Platform: 52-Card French Deck  
Region of Origin: U.S. (International Waters)  

### Why Contract Bridge

Biggest trick-taking game of the 20th century (despite being mind-bogglingly complicated)

- Most common card game mechanic
- Whist is the simplest game of interest, and first mega popular one

#### Whist

- The goal is to win the most tricks, given partners
- It is the vanilla of trick-taking games
- A trick just involves someone playing a card and high card wins, but whoever wins the last trick leaves the next trick
- I'm going to proceed to pay attention- I'd recommend reading a small tutorial but I doubt the specifics will show up on the exam
- Karnoffel means 'Hernia' and it beats anything.
- Moderate "freedom of play"
- The "scientific" game. People analyzed quite heavily (perhaps a bit too seriously).
- _Rule of 11:_ When you play a card, you don't just want to win a trick. You want to tell your partner as much as possible about the composition of your hand. For example, if you're leading the first trick you should play the 4th best card of your best suit so that your partner has an educated guess on what you have in your hand from that one play.
- Information gathering is hugely crucial

Other popular card games include...

- Hombre
- Dummy Whist - Originally a band-aid (i.e. can't find a 4th player to play), but found to require more strategy.
- Britich to bridge to auction bridge - Dummy hand, bidding contracts in suits.
  - There are four players but one person is always taking a break from the round. Partner plays both rounds.
  - You are bidding a number of tricks you think you can win, then waiting to win it
- Contract Bridge -- Bigger risks, bigger rewards
  - Bridge was doing well, and then this came along and tweaked it a little bit
  - Vulnerability. Lots of adsum zeroes.

#### Tarot

Not for divination, originally! It is originally an attempt to figure out how to have a trump suit with an entire separate suit of cards that beat everything else. They tend to be quite complicated trick taking gamees.

Back to Contract Bridge... Bidding important as an artificial language. The bidding system become said artificial language. As you make bids from low to high, such as 1 club, and thus communicating what you might guess or showing the players what your play might be. It's complicated, but essentially it circumvents talking.

The opposite of poker? It's the opposite of faking, lying, and deceit. It's "pathologically honest"- you are simply not allowed to lie. You can't pause if you have something like 1 diamond that you have to play, because that may send the signal that you have more diamonds when you really don't.

This game's popularity is also partially due to being marketed as the "couple's crucible" to prove couples' bond. In 1929, there is a huge news story of someone (Myrtle Bennett) killing her husband over a bridge game. There's a particular toxicity, but in the terms that people are compelled to play the game with a particular pull.

In the 60s the 'hippies' sort of decide it's dead and not cool.

Omar Sharif - THe last cool bridge player

### Why Contract Bridge (cont)

- The popular culmination of a 600+ year evolution of trick-taking games: the trump suit, bidding for the contract, the dummy hand
- An incredibly complex game that nonetheless became a genuine po-culturesensation for decades
- An artifical language in which every time you talk you raise the stakes
- It shouldn't be your first trick-taking game, but it might be your last!

## Poker

Date: circa 1820s  
Developer: Unknown  
Platform: Card Game  
Region of Origin: USA  

Poker is based off of various bluffing game, not sure where it specifically came from (Missisippi River maybe?) and then people started playing more heavily and became more popular in 1850s.

### Why Poker

- While bridge is a card card game, poker is a money game, played with cards. (Straights were a bit controversial)
- Short term luck, long-term skill
  - Anyone can win a poker hand
- "So the things that luck can do for you... it's one of the reasons it's such a broad game" - _Richard Garfield_
  - Note that this guy comes up for _Magic: The Gathering_
- Playing poker probabilistically versus emotionally (challenging)

### Different Versions

There was straight poker, where you deal all the cards and then bet.

Draw poker is exchanging cards for new ones after a round of betting. This one was kind of family friendly if you bet candy and stuff like that

Stud poker is only one card being face down with rounds of betting. On this note, when you compare poker to other card games, the rules of what hands you can have are less brittle. In poker, you could go from having a straight flush to nothing worthwhile with just one card.

Community stud (aka Texas Hold 'em) is the most popular version of poker these days. It's the two cards that they each player has different cards. The invention of this for televised poker makes it a great game for television.

### Texas Hold 'em

Started around 1937 (? check that). It was the dominant form of pro poker. Wasn't really loved when it first game in, but it did great.

It works because having two cards hidden and everyone having access to the other five cards is enough information to swing things, _but not overwhelming_. Odds are not super complicated and it won't get as deep as bridge, letting you focus on what matters (bluffing, betting, etc.)

Damn, poker is intense bro. You should try watching it to study body language cues.

Bluffing is not explicitly in the rules of poker. The one thing is that you can not truthfully _reveal_ your cards, but you can say what you have.

In poker, you bet the player, not the hand. There are only two cards that fluctuate between the last two players. The game we saw in lecture was the same level of math if they were betting on each having one card.

Another quote, "Poker, one of the most skill-demanding of all card games ... skills of money management are exercised" - _David Parlett_

- Cards themselves are not money that is being played

Poker chips are a ludic form of money, it is all relatively staked on what means sometjhing to people. The value of the chips is arbitrary.

### Why Poker (cont)

- The most popular skilled gambling game of the last 150 years, and the most popular traditional card game of the last half-0century
- GA genuine folk game, played by all classes, with the ascent of texas hold em a relatively authoent form of natural seleciton
- Elegant framework for relationships and deceit
- Also a game where money is arbitrary

## Monopoly

Date: 1906  
Developer: Elizabeth Magie  
Platform: Board Game  
Region of Origin: USA  

Prime example of the folk to auteur to folk to autuer twist mentioned earlier.

### Why Monopoloy

- The best-selling procedrual trauma creator of the 20th century
- From auteur to folk to auteur to folk
  - The evolution of rules is fascinating
  - Originated as a political point about land taxes, then stolen and given to Parker Brothers
- The evolution of roll-and-move games
  - Ancestor of snakes and ladders
- The Landlord's Game (Monopoly's early name)
  - Innovation through simulation
  - You don't bankrupt other players, players go around board five times and the one with the most money and resources wins
  - Some nice features got lost, (i.e. being able to use railroads to travel, luxury tax collecting interest)
- Spreads and evolves
  - In the hands of college students, it gets meaner and meaner (change from 1908 to 1928)
  - Satirical edge gets honed, such as being a horrible person and trying to bankrupt all the other players and building up huge properties that siphon money out of everyone else
- In the twenties **(mechanically best version of the game)**
  - No sales, just auction: **cerebral and ruthless**
  - _Statement of General Theory_ - Quote from Louis Thun, 1925
  - The key thing to this version, the key to why it seems like a relatively low skill game today was due to a rule change. _You do not buy things when you land on them- it goes up for auction, going for the one who pays the most._ This one change makes the skill ceiling mcuh, much higher.
  - The one value that does exist is the mortgage value, which has been in the game forever. That sets the floor for the bidding.
- Quaker monopoly gets fenced to parker brothers
  - They didn't like the auction thing for two reasons
    1. Skill set too high, want it to be a family game
    2. The auctions can be too deceitful
  - When you land on places, you can buy things from the bank as twice the mortgage price. _Mortgage is the original number!_
  - Quaker version played by Charles Darrow, patents it as "his game"
  - This lie was discovered when some guy was sued by parker's brother
  - Lizzie Magie was 'hornswoggled' into auteurship
- This was a common pattern
  - Monopoly, battleship, mafia... All have cerebral origins, no forgotten
    - Battleship - You would take several shots, and not know which ones hits and which ones don't
- Modern "folk" monopoly
  - No one really knows the rules and it goes forever.
  - Money under free parking is not an actual rule, but it keeps the game going!
- Many games like this, particulary _Squatter_ **which is australian sheep monopoly**
  - You are a sheep rancher, your property is your sheep, and you get lots of little sheep which is very nice.

### Why Monopoly (cont)

- Best selling boardgame of the 20th cenutry
- Comes by its initial innovations by polemical somulation
- Starts as an auteur game, becomes a folk game, gets stolen by a different auteur
- Derided by game desigeners, but they're playign the wrong version - the auction version has a very high skil lceiling
- There's an Ausltralian sheep ranching version (Squatter)

## Diplomacy

Date: 1959  
Developer: Allan Calhamer  
Platform: Board Game  
Region of origin: USA  

### Why Diplomacy

A game of pure politics. A game where you play WWI but more about cold war theory. Uses a form of folk game theory, such as dealing with people who might be betraying you

- Simple battles, but very complex decisions. Every unit worth 1.
  - If you need the rules, look 'em up. It's complex to type up.
  - The key thing is that every turn you write down what all your movement is going to be, and then everyone reveals their moves at the same time. You have to negotiate, and then maybe you lie, which they find out upon the reveal.
- Game doesn't have to take hours and hours, but often it does due to negotiating and arguing, etc.
- Politics are procedurally represented
- A classic game of **emotional "bleed"**
  - The idea where emotions bleed out of the game and into real life
- Precursor to role-playing games and zines
  - Lot of relationship between elaboration of diplomacy and early role playing ganes
  - Hobbyist zines allowed doplomacy to be played via mail
- Faction battles - Thematic boardgames with diplomacy's politics (cosmic encounter, dune, game of thrones, etc.)
  - **Cosmic Encounter is very much so the tie-in btwn Diplomacy and Magic: The Gathering**
  - What they share with diplomacy
    1. Simultaneous, secretly chosen actions
    2. Some sort of (usually) geographic limitation on who you can attack
    3. Polay best with 5+ players
    4. The possibility of a shared victory

## Why Dipomacy (Cont)

- Both a cold war time capsule and a timeless classic
- A clean and elegant famework for its core mechanics: negotion, alliance, betrayal
- Preceduarally represents real world politics with baorfgame politics while limiting those politics with geogrpahy
- Presages RPGs and MMOs, especially in the level of emotion "beed"
- If you've written a genre novel about ab unch of warring factions, iicense a DIplomacy style boardgame, of which you could make some money

## Jenga

Date: 1983  
Developer: Leslie Scott  
Platform: Block Game  
Origin: England  

## Why Jenga

- The (im)perfect bullseye
- The rest of Scott's games don't add up to the commercial success of Jenga
- Origins of Jenga go back to Ghana, West Africa (c 1973 when she was 13 and the game evolved)
  - They were just playing about, and then rules are suggested (to be accepted, rejected, modified, whatever)
  - Low and behold, you have a set purpose and a dilineated rules and thus a game!
- Wood blocks left over from a sawmill, and not perfectly cut. Plastic pieces were also troublesome, because then they would be too perfect for the tower to be play.
  - Dog playing Jenga very carefully and well, oddly enough

### Similar Bullseye Games (perfect one-shot games)

Set is a game of quick pattern recognition. Have to find three cards that have a similar quality or different, depending on the ruleset.

Hex is a game, known as the original connection game. Invented in the 40s by two separate people, relatively (discovered, not invented). Trying to connect to your respectively colored signs. Really the first game where the goal is connection. It inspired...

Blokus which is a modern connection classic. Auteur doesn't really come into focus for people because some games are so 'perfect', such as the second game (arlekino) being a small, small hit

Mafia and Werewolf, a game of reading and deceiving

Apples to Apples is a game consistent of anonymous udging and combinatorial humor

Dread is a single-session horror RPG. Every time you do something wrong, you remove a piece from the Jenga tower. If the tower is knocked over, something terrible happens to your character. (this would be a great camp activity or something!)

## Why Jenga (cont)

- Simple game made irreducibly complex by reality
- The archetypal abstract "one-hit wonder" (though not really)
- Seems more disoegered than invented, but it was really grown and then carefully shaped

## Settlers of Catan

Date: 1995  
Developer: Klaus Teuber  
Platform: Board Game  
Region of Origin: Germany  

Another mega hit that overshadows Teuber's other work

## Why Settlers

German boardgames conquer the mainstream. This guy was a top game designer in Germany, winning the top award three times, before Settlers was even released.

You know the rules, more or less.

Eurogames vs Ameritrash. There is indirect conflict vs direct conflict. Risk was invented in France, but a classic Ameritrash came such that you're beating on others and directly competing specific players. Eurogames tend to be much more victory point oriented, where as Ameritrash games were more of a last person standing type of win condition

### Make this into a two column table

|Eurogames|Ameritrash|

Eurogames
Some randomness, little luck
Constant multiplayer interaction
Indirect conflict
Loose relation to theme
Win via point salad

Ameritrash
Lots of luck
Lots of dice
Attack/defend
Turn structure
Crush your enemies
Strong theming, probably zombies
Win via crushing your enemies

Settlers of Catan is a crossover hit, which is why it really broke through in America.

- Lots of die rolling, but moderate luck
- Good things on your turn, liek MOnpoly
- A little direct conflict, via the Robber
- Started as a Civ game, still semi-thematic
- Win via simple point system

**The Coaster Proclamation of 1988** was made by a bunch of eurogame designers that essentially said, "we will not let our games be published without our names on the box". The award in germany is called _Spiel des Jahres_. The winners of this tend to be critically acclaimed, and more or less against war games, as if they're hidden

No war in these games, as stated above, but colonialism is fine Just no direct war

Settlers, in 2009, still going viral (article) with new players, 50 years after it was invented. There are so many catan games... SO MANY

## Why Settlers (cont)

- The breakthrough Eurogame that slowly but surely brings boardgaming into the American mainstream
- A classic Eurogame but with american touches dice a little conflict and a theme
- Doesn't make Clause Tueber a household name, but a long line of Catan games bear his name proudly

## Magic: The Gathering

Date: 1993  
Developer; Richard Garfield  
Platform: Trading Card Game  
Origin: USA  

## Why Magic

It is the original trading card game. A game made out of collecting cards and fully making your own deck.

The true precedent are other card games, and Cosmic Encounter- remember this is the link from Diplomacy to Magic. Cosmic Encounter is made up of several new cards, where each alien 'breaks the game' and variants are made as time goes on. Clearly inspired Magic.

Again, first ~~collectible~~ customizable card game. Lots of board games / hobbyist stores have Magic as the bedrock to stores. Unfortunately this contributes to some pay-to-win attributes, but gives people access to as many cards as possible.

Because it is a trading card game, there is a living meta game. The meta game "describes the strategic considerations and realities that players take into account the making decisions about a game in general, but outside of any indiviudal instance of tha game." A deck can be very good be really good in one social group, but could be terrible in another group. Other games have this, sure, but there is a much more explicit meta in a game like this.

The types of meta games

- Aggro: Attack the other player with an army of small creatures
- Combo: Very fragile because it relies on specific cards
- Control: Prevents spells from being played and tries to 'control' the state of the board

The metagame clock: Aggro --> Aggro-Control --> Control --> Combo --> Midrange --> Aggro --> ...

Is magic the origin of Pay-to-win game? Garfield didn't intend this, but it really does carry over throughout futre games

## Why Magic (cont)

- Originator of the entirely new and wildy influential genre of customizable card games
- Five colors of mana provide cost balancing an allows for players to express their own particualr playing style
- A vibrant ecosystem of leagues and tournaments creates a meta game in which no deck can exist in a vacuum
- An arguably pay to win game which presages a lot of game-as-a-service whale-hunting in the years to come
  - Note this connection to the FPS lecture!

## Dominion

Date: 2008  
Developer: Donald X. Vaccarino  
Platform: Card Game  
Origin: USA  

Very elegant, perhaps a bit too passive aggressive (multiplayer solitaire).

## Why Dominion

Deck building is a key mechanic, it is the original "deckbuilder". It's a snowball on a mobius strip, starting with a crappy deck and then being able to get better and better. _The deck building takes place within the game, Magic is done outside of the game_

Everyone starts with 7 coppers and 3 estates, used to keep buying better cards. Inspired by Magic, taking the fun deckbuilding part of things and making that hte core of the game. A common theme in deckbuilder is not just getting good cards, but also get rid of bad cards so they don't dilute your deck. **Chapel is the best card in the game since it trashes up to any 4 cards in your deck**

Just better money, or is there a special combo? You randomly pick 10 cards from random piles. The game is frontloaded and the game can be the best before the game even starts. Planning everything and seeing future combos is a largely fun aspect of it

The rules are ABC:

- Action: Play one action card from your hand; lots of them say +1 action
- Buy: Buy one card per turn, costs being in the bottom left turn; lots of them say +1 buy
- Cleanup: Whatever cards you did not play or buy, put them in your discard pile
  - This is another thing that differs You don't just draw one card at a time. You keep going through your deck in Dominion, over and over.

Victory cards are dead cards at the beginning, so you can't buy them too early, but they are incredibly important by the end. Victory cards are dead cards, essentially, until they become useful

Dominion is not a game about targeting one person **note that this is different than the other politic games!**

Ascension and star realms are games where you have a single deck, instead of stacks, and people can get cards from a common pool.

Deckbuilding as a metaphor used, such as montages and supply lines. We see these in the early 2010s. These include Friedemann Friese friday, A Few Acres of Snow, etc. Licencesed deckbuilders became the default mechanic of the 2010s.

Dominion is an endlessly expandable mosaic of cards (there are 13 at the moment)

## Why Dominion (cont)

- The originator of the most popular non0-digital game mechanic of the last decade, deckbuilding
- Feels a bit like a tech demo, which makes it incerdeibly influential in both the positive and negative sense
- Though American a classic Euro efficiency engine- elegant, satisfying, but can drift into multiplayer solitaire
- But hte combinatorial possibilities in what 10 stacks are plauyed with still gives it unparalleled variety.

## Hearthstone

Date: 2014
Developer; Blizzard Entertainment
Platform: PC/Mobile
Origin: USA

## Why Hearthstone

A pjhysical metaphor but a digital game. It's essentially Magic, but digital from the ground up.

So many aspects of Magic make it a great live game, such as counter spells and the liveliness of spells. Magic online is not as smooth as the version in the real world, but the idea of doing thing on someone else's turn is huge. In Hearthstone, _you can't do spells and stuff on someone else's turn_. Reaction phases in Magic online play is very meh

Defender has control over what's being attacked, however, and there are also no counter spells (but there are secrets, which are triggered by opponent's moves). decisions are only made on your own turn

Hearthstone is free to play, but is it pay to win?

Dream Quest is a deckbuilding roguelike, inspired by Hearthstone, and Dungeon Runs are like a dominion deckbuilder thing in these games. Slay the Spire is a deckbuilder roguelike as well.

## Why Hearthstone (cont)

- A control/experiment: What if Magic, but natively digital?
- Taunts, secrets, and random effects leverage digital affordances, while maintainining the physical metaphor of cards
- Uses the WoW world to attract old fans, while introducing card players to it
- Works as a causal game or a serious e-sport... if you're willing to CRACK. THE. PACKS.

## Pandemic LEgacy

Date: 2015  
Developer: Rob Daviau and Matt Leacock  
Platform; Consumable Board Game  
Origin: USA  

Based on coop games and legacy games. Early co-op games were for early hippies. Lord of the rings was the first breakthrough co-op eurogame- note the puppetmaster issue.

Pandemic is a mainstream co-op breakthrough. Forbidden island is like a baby pandemic.

Risk legacy is a boardgame as a consumable experiences as well.

A legacy game is where you alter a board after you play a specific game. After you play it 12 or 15 times, you're done wiht it.

Permadeath meets "legacy", such as binding of isaac.

Risk Legacy is a boardgame as a one-way object, but in the 2010s this game being used just a few times was a great experience, and futre games would keep building off of each other.

Boardgames as one-use games, such as "escape rooms in a box"

Legacy play lets board games exist as a model of game to keep around and a symbol to keep.

Pandemic, as a legacy game. It's pandemic as a legacy game, and is a great coop game combined with everything that is done carries over to the next time. Lots of narrative componnents. Second highest ranked board game.

Gloomhaven was number one game, which is a boardgame as ameri-eurolegacy megacame

## Why Pandemic (cont)

- Blockbuster culmination of two of the hottest trends in 21st century boardgames: coop and legacy
- A narrative that starts like a regular game of Pandemic but quickly becomes a unique one-time experience
- Plays with the aboos of baordgames, don't destroy etc.
- Only conceivable...
