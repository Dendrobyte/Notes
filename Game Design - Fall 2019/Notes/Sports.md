Dev: Unknown  
Platform: Multiple Physical Games  
Origin: Ancient Greece  

**"Arete":** Virtue. Excellence. Reaching highest potential. Courage and strength in the face of adversity. The best physical self is key

Number of games/events have increased dramatically

Simon Manuel - First African American woman to win gold in swimming. This was a win larger than just one person. Usain bolt winning as well. _It's about national pride._

### Why Olympic Games

Soccer 'field' is the same as soccer 'pitch'

### Why Soccer

- World's most popular sport (by far)
- Very team oriented
- Very simple team sport
  - Easy to play in environments
- Elegant; easy to play but tricky to master
- Side effects of simplicity
  - Fuzzy rules, hard to enforce

  - Referreeing also pretty vague and taken advantage of, such as faking/playing up injuries

## Cricket

Date: 1774 CE  
Dev: Unknown  
Platform: Ball Game  
Origin: England (possibly Belgium)  

18th century, official game of england.  A bowler is sort of like a pitcher, there are two batsmen, and wickets are where the bowler hits the ball to score runs.

The field is round, leading to no 'out of bounds' rules. Requires insane reaction times.

### Why Cricket

- Secondm ost popular, most watched, sport in the world
- Team sport, very individualized
- Slow paced (5 days is the standard time for rounds)

    - Literally let to things being on the verge of revolt
- The first largest controversy- N2 needs a 6
  - Australia just rolls ball on the ground; "the ball that changed Cricket"

  - Complete match played in about 3 hours
  - Disappoints those who are for traditional cricket

Dev: Unknown  
Platform: Ball Game

Originally a game meant for royalty.

Women's tennis eclipses men's tennis in popularity. However ,women only play 3 sets and men play 5. It is unfair to play 3 sets because randomness plays a larger role

Serena Williams (Aus open when 8 weeks pregnant) and Margeret Court (64 grandslam championships/tournaments) were influential players. There is still a lot of issue with sexism in Tennis

### Why Tennis
