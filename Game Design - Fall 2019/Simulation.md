# Simulation

Renee Magritte created the painting _The Treachery of Images_, "Ceci n'est pas une pipe"

## What is a simulation

**A simulation** is a _procedural_ (rule-based) representation of aspects of 'reality'

**Rules of Simulations:**

1. Simulations are representations
2. They are process-based (prcedural)
3. They have a particular relationship to 'reality'

## The Game of Life

A simulation of life through simple rules about cells, invented by mathematician John Conway in 1970. Wanted to create a simple representation of life for single-celled organisms. From simple rules we see a large amount of complexity. We have initial conditions with rules applied, and we are given a simulation.

From these simple rules applied, as the grid expands we see a large amount of different patterns that reoccur. Some patterns, such as the _r pentamino_ take several (thousand) cycles where we see new patterns emerge.

The game of life is less of a game and more of a cool mathematical toy.

**Emergent behavior** is the 'emerging' of behavior from a variety of rules where the 'emerging' is not strictly defined.

## What counts as a 'simulation game'

A simulation can allow you to be playful, but especially allows us to gain a deeper understanding of how life works. We can think of all games as simulations, but not all simulations are games.

## Oregon Trail

Date: 1971 CE  
Dev: Don Rawitsch w/ MECC  
Platform: HP-2100  
Origin: USA  

Created by a student teacher and meant to be used as an educational tool, MECC was a company to make educational softwares.

### Why Oregon Trail

It was a super successful educational game. It didn't appen just because of its design, but because of its cultural factors. However, it was a skewed 'particular relationship' with real history; there were a lot of things it left out from reality (think back to the definition of simulation). It perpetuates the fantasy of the Manifest Destiny idea.

When we think about what simulations are simulating, we need to remember what part of reality is being simulated and what is being left out. Also, who's perception of reality we are creating.

## Lemonade Stand

Date: 1973 CE  
Dev: Bob Jamison w/ MECC  
Platform: UNIVAC 1100  
Origin: USA  

The idea of this game is that you are playing as a child running a lemonade stand, defining how much you're selling for, the supplies you're buying, etc. The game also has (fairly basic) weather simulation and conditions that you can react to when you make decisions on how to run the lemonade stand.

### Why Lemonade Stand

It is capitalism for everybody. It contains a lot about scarcity that it doesn't specifically address- you're just reacting to those things. A simple simulation with a range of complex capabilities.

There is no examination of whether or not there is a best way to do something. No critical lense toward the decisions you are making.

## Microsoft Flight Simulator

Date: 1980 CE  
Dev: Bruce Artwick w/ subLOGIC  
Platform: Apple II  
Origin: USA  

Falls into the vehicle sim category/sub-genre. There is no particular goal, point system, sense of progression; you are simply learning how to fly a plane [in the original version, later versions do have other features]. Incredibly comple key-mapping, since it asked you to control all sorts of things.

### Why Microsoft Flight Simulator

A 'vertical slice'. It is a portion of what it is to be a pilot, where you'll always just be a pilot sitting in a cockpit without trying to raise up the ranks or anything. There are other portions of a pilot's life that it is not simulating.

The vehicle simulator genre is a fairly common way for games to get deep into a narrow subject matter, such as Microsoft Train Simulator (2001) and Gran Turismo 5 (2010).

There becomes a blurring of the lines between fun simulation games and actual simulation programs intended for training. In some actual context, simulations can give us real-world literacy about how a system works.

## Gran Turismo (Series)

Date: 1997 CE - Present  
Dev: Kazunori Yamauchi w/ Polyphony Digital  
Platform: PlayStation  
Origin: Japan  

The simulation of these games goes incredibly in-depth. The original game (1997) [2 was released in (1999)] had about 5 years spent on it, really focusing on getting in-depth on physics, handling, etc.

Lots of it used real life numbers from actual cars to create these simulations. Even though the series continues to progress, the progress through games is more of evolution versus innvation; nothing drastic is happening, the core of the simulation is the same. The numbers in these types really do matter.

### Why Gran Turismo

Is it a game or simulation? If we understand the rules of how this simulation works, are we better able to understand the game _and maybe even the real world?_ It is an incredibly accurate simulation.

We can use the idea of the gap between reality and simulated version as a commentary aspects. We can choose to simulate parts of a system and not other parts of things. Leaves potential for serious vs comedic commentary.

## Elite

Date: 1984 CE  
Dev: David Braben & Ian Bell  
Platform: BBC Micro  
Origin: England  

A vehicle, of sorts, but a space trading game. A key aspects of space combat/trading/exploration genre of simulation games. Items can be acquired from asteroid mining, piracy acts, buyung things, etc.

One of the first home computer games to use wireframe 3D graphics and it was also an interesting example of procedural generation. It contained several aspects of universes, and was an interesting technical exploration of such an act. Instrumental in the idea of procedurally generating not just planets but all kinds of things.

_This is the kind of game that inspired games similar to No Man's Sky (2016)_, it's pretty much an early lower-quality (graphically/hardware-wise, at least) version of No Man's Sky. A modern version of the game.

Another game inspired by this was _Spore (2008)_. While it was slightly disappointing, it brought about this realization/idea of simulating everything- simulating simple life forms to more complex life forms.

### Why Elite

It managed to do so much with just a little bit of presentation.

## FIFA (Series)

Date: 1993 - Present  
Dev: EA Sports  
Platform: Sega Genesis  
Origin: USA  

Made by a team of 10 developers under the working title of EA Soccer

Later, EA signed a 5-year deal with FIFA (the main soccer organization) which was a big deal, however the rights ddn't incliude any actual team or player names. The game did well in Europe, but EA wasn't confidence that the FIFA license would have much power for a NA audience- thus they wanted to release it as "Team USA World Soccer", but retracted that bad decision...

In the first four weeks alone, it sold over a half-million copies and was the most successful game of 1993.

We see that the game uses an isometric viewpoint, whereas other games had more of a top-down view.

First-touch gameplay was introduced in 2004, bringing procedural representation closer to real life. There are several ways in which it brought more realistic spects; weather statistics (2014), ai to players, etc. female characters (2016).

Can't forget it's incredible large cultural importance, one of the best-selling game franchises and the best-selling sports game franchise.

Decisions about what is represented in a simulation and what is not is a clear decision that some is making down the line

### Why FIFA

Iterative simulations- the game continues to change and modify its relationship with reality.

## SimCity

Date: 1989 CE  
Dev: Will Wright w/ Maxis  
Platform: Macintosh  
Origin: USA  

Real anchorpoint in cultural memory and the genre of simulation games at large.

There is a wide variety of sources for inspiration, such as _Pinball Construction Set_ (1983), which allowed you to design your own pinball tables, _A Pattern Language_ which was a book by an architect, Christopher Alexander, and then the main point, _Raid on Bungeling Bay_(1984) which was the first game that he worked on. He realized the map creator within this game was fun on its own, and thus Sim City (1989) was born.

The game was actually developed in 1985 for the Commodore 64, but didn't get it published until 4 years later. It represents a paradigm in games such that you can't win or lose, which led to game publishers being hesitant to publish his game.

The game was awarded several awards, and naturally it had further iterations. Sim City 2000 (1994) used a more isometric view and such. In these simulation games the idea of complexity and simulating various 'slices' of life played a large role in the development and specifically evolution of these games.

You can dig deep into the model underlying this type o game, and the game can be turned into a complex puzzle of optimization within the bounds of an already intensely complex game (Magnus Anta[?]) for this giant city. _It would be a super cool video series, or just standalone video, to do this kind of thing._

### Why SimCity

You, the player, are the mayor for life. It is an interesting example of a game that is emblematic of the sim game genre.

## The Sims

Date: 2000 CE  
Dev: Will Wright w/ Maxis  
Platform: PC  
Origin: US  

We see each 'person' in these games have specific characteristics and attributes. They start with certain attributes, but their needs adapt to what is going on in their environment.

Draws a little bit on Victorian Dollhouse play, and we are allowed to use the SIMS as a way to subvert social norms and such.

Each object in the SIMs, each object has a particular purpose and set of properties such that it can satisfy the needs of one's SIMs. Lots of the game is filling SIMs houses with more and more stuff, filling in the perpetual of buying more stuff to have more needs which elads to needing to buy more stuff, etc.

### Why SIMs

We can see emergent stories about people that form between the interaction between the SIMs and there are also various blogs on the internet of people recounting stories of their games.

## Angelique (Series)

Date: 1994 - Present  
Dev: Ruby Party w/ Koei  
Platform: Super Famicom  
Origin: Japan  

A series of dating simulation games. You are playing as a 17 year old girl (Angelique) who is being tested to see if she is worth of becoming the next queen. Throughotu the game, you can choose whether you want to pursue a guardian or then becoming a queen. You can not become a queen if you forfeit your chance as a queen.

The developer of the series, Keiko Erikawa, who wanted to help define gender represenation in the Japanese game industry. She hired a team of women and created the Angelique series, which was the motivator for the creation of said series.

Based on simulation games and their relationships with reality, we see dating and the mechanisms falling into the trap of what some call 'kindness coins'. Kindness and similar reactions are currency. Relationships are actually weird and complicated, and not some "Kindness Capitalism". When you're being kind out of self-interest, such that you get something from characters, isn't kindness- it's just being selfish. ([araphrased from quote by Patricia Hernandez who wrote an article on Kotaku (?))

How do we avoid this problem of using NPCs as currency, and are we doing a good job of it? There is a game on itch.io called Kindness Coins (2013) that explores this idea further. There are several articles written about it, and the lecturer wrote a chapter also (NPCs need love too, mitu khandaker-kokoris).

Simulation games are largely doing two things:

1. Building on the players mental model of the world
2. Informing the players mental model of the world?

Is it super healthy if we having something like the kindness coin model on games? In general, the building and informing of one's mental model is a large aspect of simulation games.

"Simulations are always reductionist, important to be conscientious reductionist- especially so when it comes to people and how we treat them?" There is always some sort of simplified reality in simulation games. They can have varying fidelities to the real world, and it is important that when we are designing these systems we need to be conscientious- especially being conscientious about reductionist principles- and especially how it eals with how we interact with people.

## _Things left out of simulations/procedural represenations are just as important as things left in_
