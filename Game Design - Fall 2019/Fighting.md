## Violence

Violence is apparent pretty much everywhere and all the way through human history.

"The natural state of men, before they entered into society, was a mere war, and that not simply, but a war of all men against all men", Thomas Hobbes. No point in history where violence amongst humankind was not visibly apparent.

Pretty much any culture you look at in the history of the world has some form of martial art- or some form of organized violence. Every culture takes its own protection, defense, and its own systems of warfare/combat, systematizing them into a martial art.

There are games _ABOUT_ violence, but we start with talking about games _OF_ violence; the games themselves are about doing violence

## Boxing

Date: 1743  
Dev: Jack Broughton, et al.  
Platform: Combat Sport  
Origin: England  

Early gloved fighting dates first appears around 1500 to 900 BCE. English bare-knuckle prize fighting is where our story first starts, which begins to grow mid-16th century. Early steps to regulating bare-knuckle boxing, bringing it closer to what we know as boxing today, was started by Jack Broughton and George Stevenson. Broughton and Stevenson were big rivals, and Broughton was one of the greatest fighters of all time each with their own amphitheater (now known as gyms). Stevenson was more traditional, relying on brute force, while Broughton focused more on technique. One day Broughton did so much damage that Stevenson died at one point and created the very beginning rules of what would become boxing.

### Broughton's Rules

1. A fighter may not hit a downed opponent
2. If a fighter can't rise after 30 seconds, the fight is over
3. No grabbing below the waist
   1. Tipping someone over and head speeding toward the earth
4. 'Mufflers' (gloves) are "required" [read: heavily encouraged]

Most deaths in all fights are due to someone falling and hitting their head too hard on the ground.

### Why Boxing

Controlled violence - Wreckless and a sport without rules is given rules over time and refined into something that is more tolerable as a sport _and as a game_.

#### Marquess of Queensbury Rules (1876)

These are the rules we know as the main rules today

1. Gloves are required
2. 3 minute rounds
3. Rest periods between rounds
4. No wrestling at all
5. 10 second count (from 30 second count)
   1. This is still a long time, and there has been talk of bringing this down even more
6. etc. We see a lot of effort to drain out a lot of the danger involved

## Fencing

Date: 1763  
Dev: Domenico Angelo, et al.  
Platform: Combat Sport  
Origin: England  

As soon as people realized people could hit each other with fists, they realized they could hit each other with fists...

Swords and weapons and status symbols - Started out in the bronze age as smithing became more of a thing. Despite becoming phased out as firearms came about, swords have maintained their power as a status symbol.

Dueling as the origin of fencing - As firearms become more important, the sword begins to adapt to the new context as sideswords (ones you carry with you for close combat/personal protection). A culture of dueling is developed as well

Fencing becomes a sport - Sword fighting would have phased out, if not for a movement to preserve it as a sport. It was rescued by people like our boi Domenico Angelo. He moved to London specifically so he could teach continental sword fighting to the children of English aristocrats. The important thing Angelo realized, people no longer thought of a sword as self defense, so he had to figure out how to market fencing. His innovation or gift was not as a swordfighter, but as a marketer. He convinced astocrats of fencing not as a martial art, but as a lifestyle for poise, discipline, etc.

### Why Fencing

Futuristic sport - The idea of even getting blood from an opponent has almost entirely dissolved. It has become a much more sporty activity versus one of self-defense. It is so different from when it has began

Cyborg sport - Electronics became built into it, and once people were not afraid of actually dying, people would be more willing to go in for the lunges. Masks and the vests are there for protection and wired to detect when someone is tagged

The first esport - 1983, the first sport that can not be played without electronics

Other traditions of fencing includes Kendo and H.E.M.A.

## Kyokushin Karate

Date: 1950 (Around 1950)  
Dev: Masatatsu 'Mas' Oyama  
Platform: Martial Art  
Origin: Japan (Okinawa)  

Chinese traders/travelers carried with them chinese martial arts (kenpo), and once it was imported in Okinawa, around 1609 it gets taken over by Shimizu clan in Japan. Law instated such that no Okinawan can carry weapons with them. Thus, they developed a form of martial art (karate).

We are talking specifically about _Kyokushin Karate_. Oyama was a pilot in WWII, and after that he was shaken and angry that his home country had become occupied by a foreign force, and then developed a fighting style after getting in many fights with the American soldiers that were just doing whatever the heck they wanted.

He trained in isolation by himself and physicall trained his body to withstand punishment. He had studied Shotukan, Gojuru, and began developing his own style based on being able to absorb enormous amounts of physical punishment. Once he game down from the mountain, he began spreading his idea of martial arts in different villages, advertising regain control over the self- over their own lives.

From the very beginning, Kyokushin is measured by its ability to withstand hit and good marketing- people wanting to regain control. Karate remains being able to take punishment.

### Why Kyokushin

A Modern Martial Art - Oyama's genius was not just through his developing of karate, but his marketing was also important. His anger toward the USA fueled him to tie the rift and traveled to the US and set up different dojos. He was a writer of many best selling books, and enthusasiastic to "train" movie stars.

Martial Arts in the contemporary world - Sonny Chiba (sort of the Bruce Lee of Japan) is one of Oyama's students. Oyama knew that getting martial arts into the modern world was not about these old style films, but about contemporary people walking around in today's world knowing martial arts.

## Street Fighter (Series)

Date: 1987 - Present  
Dev: Takashi Nishiyama & Hiroshi Matsumoto w/ Capcom  
Platform: Arcade  
Origin: Japan  

Early 2D fighting games include Karate Champ (1984) and Way of the Exploding FIst (1985), where you can see most of what we understand about fighting games; two players fighting, some background eleemnts, basic buttons, health, etc. We then see Street Fighter in 1987 as a singleplayer arcade game where you play Ryu fighting the great fighters of the world. You can play Ryu vs Ken if there was a second player in the arcade with you. It's not originally thought of as a 1v1 game, but it started essentially as a 1-player game.

Street Fighter 2 (1991) is when the formula really gets figured out. It is designed from the ground up to be a multiplayer game where a second player can choose to be whoever they want. They also widened the input window so your movements didn't have to be so frame perfect.

### Why Street Fighter

The fireball - Executing a special move became more important. The fireball is what makes 2D fighting games work; if you give up as martial arts as a simulation and more of a fantasy, fighting games are made into what we know them. The fireball is so important because it forces the opposing player to make a decision.

The player who throws the fireball can then plan from the small set of possible reactions to the fireball. It makes fighting games much less about who has a faster twitch reaction, and more about how space can best be used, like chess, and much more like a strategy type of game. _It is not about doing damage to your opponent, but being smart through control of space._ It makes it much more of a strategy game; the fireball makes it more than just a button masher.

Language games - A lot of the terms heard around other games originate here ("salty", "scrub", "bodied", "on tilt", "pop-off", etc.) That is no accident- it is because Street Fighter is a culture, and as a culture they are much more hooked into the popular jargon of the times (specifically the 90s). People playing Street Fighter while hearing this jaron heard in pop culture music and such.

Some other important 2D fighting games include Mortal Kombat, King of Fighters, Marvel vs. Capcom, and Dragon Ball Fighterz

Martial Arts

1. Controlling violence as much as expressing it
2. As much emphasis on training as actually fighting
3. Often slow-paced with bursts of action.

Fighting Games

1. About discreet, chess-like control of space [chess with quick time events]
2. Based around specific moves and combos
3. Fighting game culture often as an affinity for the values of tradition martial arts

## Tekken (Series)

Date: 1994 - Present  
Dev: Namco  
Platform: Arcade  
Origin: Japan  

2D & 3D parallel development - These grew up in parallel, such as the 2D Street Fighter 2 (1991) and then the 3D Virtua Fighter (1993). 3D was not an evolution, both games were developing at the same time. Later, the 3D Tekken (1994) [w/ Tekken!]

What doesn't work in 3D? - The question we have is what really changes? They are very different styles of fighting games. For example, the fireball doesn't work since the player can just step aside. Since they can't rely on this one plane, the depth comes from **Yomi**. The concept was developed by a player gamed David Serlin.

**Yomi:** Knowing the mind of your opponent. At the core is this idea that you don't know what is in the mind of your opponent, but then all the sudden it becomes a long train of "you think i think that you think..." etc. All it needs is those three steps of Attack => Throw => Block/Dodge => Attack => ...

What you're doing in a 3D fighter game is playing rocks/paper/scissors over and over again very fast, since you can't control space in the same way you can a 2D fighter game. It becomes less about controlling space, and getting inside the mind of your opponent. Tekken is Yomi in overdrive, with the incredibly detailed ruleset and level of thinking allowing the same depth and high-level plan as 2D players.

Other important 3D fighting games - Virtua Fighter, Soul Calibur, Dead or Alive

2D Fighting Games

1. More chess-like, with long term tactical and staregic play
2. Traditionally has smaller move sets

3D Fighting Games

1. Based around yomi-like mind games and quick reaction times
2. Traditionally has larger move sets

## Bushido Blade

Date: 1997  
Dev: Lightweight Co.  
Platform: Playstation  
Origin: Japan  

### Why Bushido Blade

The road untraveled - Fighting games is a genre a lot weirder than a lot of people realize.

It's weird - It's just different and has strange things than other fighting games

1. Instead of different stages, it has one continuous arena
2. You can turn and run from your opponent
3. All characters are symmetrical, where moves are based on chosen weapons
4. There are no health bars, able to down your opponent in one hit

Akira Kurosawa invented blood spray - The film clip we watched in class, and blood spray was invented by Kurosawa., the mild-mannered and very brainy Japanese director.

Play weird games - Bushido Blade looks at fighting games from a different cultural perspective. Weird and strange games are just so famous and influential to be covered in this class, such as Bushido Blade, but playing weird games are interesting because they do a lot of weird things.

## Super Smash Bros (Series)

Date: 1999 - Present  
Dev: Masahiro Sakurai w/ Nintendo  
Platform: Nintendo 64  
Origin: Japan  

## Why Smash Bros

Design innovation - It's the last kind of big innovation/design in fighting games. It upended and changed the formula from the traditional 2D/3D games and it is becoming a sort of genre as its own. Innovations include...

1. Weight (the percentage thing), no health bars
2. Edges, not endless ground and no walls all around
   1. There are two games; the game played on the platform like a regular fighting game, and then there's the 'edge' game
3. Stocks, no best two of three or anything (incentive to keep doing damage)
4. Dynamic Stages (fighting game and party game, allowed experimental stage design)
5. APM (emerged out of the wya melee plays)
   1. APM == **A**ctions **P**er **M**inute

Smash Bros allowed other fighting games to experiment more with the style of gameplay

Contemporary fighting games - Mixed martial arts, Nidhogg 2, Skullgirls, For Honor (perhaps an attempt at doing Bushido Blade well).
