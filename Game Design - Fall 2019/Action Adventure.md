# Action Adventure

## Key Concepts

- Duckbilled platypus is spirit animal for action-adventure games
- The action-adventure game was born from trying ot make an adventure game for the Atari 2600
- The defining characte3ristic of aciton-adventure games is the lack of genre compromises (both of these two genres slammed together)
- There is a strong tradition of auteurs in action-adventure games
  - This is where we have some of the most famous names and developers
- Emergence and progression as two modes in games, and how they're alternated between in action-adventure games
- The emergence of the action-adventure-rpg as the dominant video game genre
- Richard Wagner's ideas of the Gesamtkunstwerk as a model for action-adventure games.

## The Duck-Billed Platypus

This animal is a strange creature. It is not a blending of different species, but more of a direct cross of a duck and a beaver. Action-adventure games are similar to this; they are not a blended version of games, but multiple things recognizable as individual components and all work together.

## Adventure

Date: 1979  
Dev: Warren Robinett w/ Atari  
Platform: Atari 2600  
Origin: United States  

Warren Robinett created the game when he was just getting into game development.

### Why Adventure

- First of its kind. A unique game that comes at the dawn of its kind; it is the first of its kind. The dominant arcade games and didn't fall under the categories of arcade, etc.
- It was the first of its kind, and thus introduced several new concepts
  - Top-down spacial movement. Originally people thought it was a bug when you go through the top of the screen and end up at the bottom.
  - Picking up objects via collision
  - Very first use of fog of war
  - Easter eggs added
- No compromises. A defining feature of action-adventure games... Think back to the important aspects of action games and adventure games. In other words, things are taken from the two genres and puts them next to each other, it's not just some homogenous mix.

Difficulty setting 2 is the real game. The difficulty channels were used to make different channels of the game; 1 was for a tutorial, 2 for actual game, 3 randomizes a bunch of stuff. Castles have non-euclidian mazes.

The Atari 2600 is designed from the ground up in order to bring arcade games home, meaning it was designed for only arcade games. Couldn't keep things in memory, such as in memory, so Robinett had to work with that. He wanted to make a game that had the flavor from the adventure (text-based) games that he loved, but that worked on the Atari VCS. He didn't come up with some hybrid genre, he just used them both. Avatar-based and positional from action games, exploration and object collecting from adventure games.

## The Legend of Zelda (Series)

Date: 1986 - Present  
Dev: shigery Miyamoto w/ Nintendo R&D4  
Platform: NES (FAMICOM)  
Region of Origin: Japan  

Sort of a clone/spinoff on the new genre that _Adventure- brings into it. He makes even less compromises, doing more of both. Miyamoto took this formula, and shaped it into a franchise showing up on pretty much every [Nintendo] console. Franchise later passed on to Eiji Aonuma. The franchise is bigger than any single person... two people in charge of maintaining this formula

## Why The Legend of Zelda

- What's really important is that it is the gold standard, coming along at a certain time and for a certain audience, of defining action-adventure games. To know what action-adventure games are in the modern time, you take a look at the most recent Zelda.
- We see...
  - Avatar based
  - Positional
  - Reflex Intensive
  - Exploration
  - Collecting Objects
  - Puzzles
  - Storytelling [except for the very early games]

## Another World

Date: 1991  
Dev: Éric Chahi  
Platform: Amiga  
Origin: France  

## Why Another World

- Auteur Theory: An auteur is a creative person that tends to be the sole driving creative director, or author, of some work. This idea comes out of French cinema. It takes a lot of people to make a movie, a game, etc. and in the late 60s this idea grew that states there are a few people have singular/oligarchic control over hte process of the movie; how it operates, what it means, etc. Those should be placed at the feet of the _auteurs_, who are sometimes directors, producers, etc. The auteur is the name that you hear in association for movies, and this is very rare in games- we usually associate entire companies.
- Éric is one of the earliest auteurs in games, but you could argue the earliest auteurs are the ones who design each part of games (Nishikado & Space Invaders). However, they are not thought of in the same way as film auteurs. He touched pretty much every part of _Another World_; he did all the pixelart (rotoscoped), he did all of the cutscenes (hand animated), all of the sound design, puzzle design, etc.
- This game is an example of a genre that exists as a sub-genre within action-adventure games that sort of died out.
- It is the cinematic platformer; building off of Prince of Persia (1989) and Flashback (1992). Very deeply shaped by the idea of playing it on the PC. Other cinematic platformers include This War of Mine (2014), Rain World (2017), Inside (2017)
- We see...
  - Visual storytelling
  - Environmental puzzles
  - Jumping puzzles
  - Rich, detailed animation

Tomb Raider

Date: 1996  
Dev: Toby Gard w/ Core Design  
Platform: Sega Saturn  
Origin: England  

Toby Gard originally got the idea for Tomb Raider because he wanted to do an action-adventure game that recaptured some of the fun he had with old adventure stories, like Indiana Jones. He wanted to actually represent an independent main character.

## Why Tomb Raider

- Lara Croft because an important character design because it made something that seemed slow and ponderous into a huge chain of video games.
- The core design era (1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2003)
  - They release games annually for a long time, almost everyone burned it to the ground
- Crystal Dynamics Era (2006, 2007, 2009)
- People keep making these games because of Lara Croft.
- The mood of these games is hard to figure out, it remains a cerebral mood and not fully an action game. The world is the puzzle
- Nathan Drake is virtually a copycat of Indiana Jones, but based more off of Lara Croft's character.
- One of the weirdest thing is that Tomb Raider passes the Bechdel Test
  - The Bechdel Test is the test where two women have a conversation and passing it means that conversation never mentions a man.

## Grand Theft Auto (Series)

Date: 1997  
Dev: Rockstar Games  
Platform: PlayStation  
Origin: USA & Scotland  

Sam and Dan Houser are the brothers that are in charge of Rockstar Games. Inherited a large pile of money from which they started Rockstar. Sam is much more the mastermind behind the company, and Dan is much more on the creative side; writing team, development team, etc. They are famous dismissive of the game industry as an industry, thinking of themselves as part of the culture/film industry.

Grand Theft Auto I (1997) and Grand Theft Auto II (1999). They are more traditionally action-adventure games. You are looking at games that function like adventures, and are very much in the action-adventure mold.

Grand Theft Auto III (2001) transitioned the game into what we now think of it as. It brings the games into an open city, doing quests, with an open world at the center. It's the game that popularized the 'open world' game idea.

At the heart of an open world we have _progression_ and _emergence_. There is an incredibly important book called _half-real_ by Jesper Juul, explaining that progression and emergence is an incredibly important quality in the design of all games. When we look at early action arade games, you could play them over and over and over again. Emergence and progression are mutually exclusive. A ruleset that defines what you do can not lead to more rules and more states. The heart of action-adventure games, a great example being GTA, is _modes of emergence and modes of progression_. In GTA, there lies _emergence_ in the world which directs a _progressive_ narrative of the game.

Action _and_ adventure, emergence _and_ progression
**Progression:** is a set course of action by a designer that the player must complete.
**Emergence:** is the ability for new/special features to come out of existing gameplay that are not explicitly defined.

## Dark Souls

Date: 2011  
Dev: Hidetaka Miyazaki w/ From Software  
Platform: Xbox 360, PlayStation 3  
Origin: Japan  

Miyazaki quit his job of being a product manager at Oracle to pursue games, and at the time From Software created shovelware. It is not known as a leader of game design in the time. He wanted to create a game that captured his vision of what video games could be. He said that if his project failed, no one would care because it was alreayd a failure.

Miyazaki has an interesting history. He chose to pursue video games because of Fumito Ueda, who wanted to make video games after working to become an artist and ends up working at Sony. He goes ahead and makes Iko, Shadow of the Colossus, and the Last Guardian. The game that inspired Ueda was _Another World_! He saw the Chahi made a game, and believed he could make a game. Everything goes full circle!

Dark Souls is a deliberate, slow-paced, moodify game. The idea comes from Chahi, such that games can be slow and impactful in their story. The boss fights is where you can most feel the influence of Ueda.

Dark Souls is so important and almost becomes a sub-genre within itself because it exemplifies the **Risk/Reward loop**. The idea of a gameplay loop is important; a game is a circuit you get on to, a treadmill of sorts, that you enjoy being on. It remains the same but importantly different each time.

### A Great Gameplay Loop

1. Encounter an enemy
2. Die
3. Find your souls
4. Retrieve your souls
5. Level up!
6. Try again
7. Repeat...

The souls are a very carefully managed system of currency. You get a little more powerful, you get a little more knowledge, and through getting better you get further and further with this game loop. There is a specific challenge in the way that you die- it feels finely tuned to what your current skillset is, just beyond it. Pretty much no game has really done this before, and this 'subgenre' is a "souls life"

Dark Souls is also emblematic as a "new" version of the action-adventure game: the action-adventure-rpg that has come up in the last 10 years or so. RPG mechanics are now in virtually every single video game genre on earth: killing monsters, numbers go up, you level up, fight more monsters, more levels, etc. It is that formula from D&D that is in everything from Assassin's Creed to Clash of Clans. All AAA games are pretty much open world action-adventure-rpg games. In the future, action-adventure being the big thing will become action-adventure-rpg.

## Metal Gear (Series)

Date: 1987 - 2015  
Dev: Hideo Kokima w/ Konai  
Platform: MSX 2  
Origin: Japan  

Very old/early example of an adventure game. Adventure (1979) to LoZ (1986) and now to Metal Gear (1987). However, there is a game called Castle Wolfenstein (1981) that goes in this timeline, then Beyond Castle Wolfenstein (1984). BCW is likely a common ancestor of metal gear. The stealthy aspect of BCW, and other qualities of it, show this game as a pretty direct predecessor of Metal Gear. Lots of storytelling, lots of world building. CW also a predecessor of WOlfenstein 3D (1992), which is one of the predecessor of Doom! Thus, _Castle Wolfenstein might just be the most important game we have never heard of_.

Why Metal Gear? It has no compromises- well, every game has compromises but it rapidly switches between action and adventure modes. Kojima was also inspired by Another World, and continued to want to be a film maker by simply inserting movies into his games. He also includes "radio dramas" and makes it work. And thus, in the design we have progression and emergence both reflected.

We talk about Metal Gear because it is an approach to games- an idea about games that games should they should aspire to- which is known as **Gesamtkunstwerk**, which is **The Total Artwork**, popularized by Richard Wagner where music is the derivation of a story. This guy is the reason you quiet down when lights go out; reducing the lights when a performance is about to begin so you can only see the stage. This idea that he came up with explains why Wagner considers Opera as the ultimate art form; stage design, music, etc. The artwork composed of other artworks. Metal Gear involves acting, voice acting, game design, and so much more.

Without _Another World_, we don't get these later developers and amazing artists, falling under the line of auteurship. The lack of compromise, just slamming the two genres together, can be mixed and matched however you want.
