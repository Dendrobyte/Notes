# Action Games

## Key Concepts

- FIrst video games, evolving from arcade instruments and cpu lab experiments
- Early design features for design of hardware and how they go away
- Commercial move to living room classes changes design
- Some styles continually evolve over 50 years or leap forward during 3D revolution
  - While others reach evolutionary dead ends
- Not all evolutions driven by technology
- Approaching lecture from where they came from
  - Convergent evolution
  - All genres being result of experiments

## The Penny Arcade, 19th Century CE

- Little rooms with small machines to play some small games
- This was the existing model from which arcade games came from
- Pinball; the missing link between video games and analogue games
  - A weird mix of digital and non-digital machines
- Pacinko grows out of early pinball machines
- Baglietall Games
- Pinball originally just a plunger
- Humpty dumpty (1947), Harry Mabs
  - First emergence of Flippers (6, inward flippers)
- Spot Bowler (1948), Wayn Neyers
  - Simulation of bowling, not special idea to 'fix' pinball
  - Became prototypical pinball cabinet
- Pinball was extremely important pop culture reference
  - NY Mayoer that hated pinball, was the video games of its time (youth culture, etc)
- Pinball colossal cultural project in the 70s
  - The Who rock opera w/ Elton John
- Periscope (1965), Namco
  - Didn't appear but adapted to the popularity of pinball
  - No microprocessor; no cpus and no screen
- Road Runner (1971), Bally
  - Projection of cars with your car being on a robotic arm
  - Senses collision plays animation
- No circuitboards, no clips, in these games. It's all being done through passage of electricity and actual inner gears

## Spacewar!

Date: 1962  
Dev: Steve Russell, Martin Graetz, Wayne Witaenam  
Platform: PDP-1  
Origin: USA  

- Running on (big) microprocessor; allows it to do certain things like physics simluation
- The PDP-1 specifically is what allowed it to do these smooth things
- On a vector display, earlier than CRT
- ector display is a photo firing quickly at the screen
  - Phosphor on inside of glass
  - The smear is because the phsphor couldn't give up light fast enough

### Why Spacewar!

- One of the oldest games we know of running a computer and the most influential
  - First real full video game
- Uses unique affordances of a real computer to create a simulated physical game
- Shows that ancestors don't emerge from arcade

## Computer Space (1971), Nolan Bushnell

- First arcade video game
- Soyl machine mount (????)
- Not a hit because looks weird and unintuitive controls
  - Singleplayer; proto asteroid
- He invested in it to commercialize it
- No microprocessor; didn't feel as good as spacerwar!
  - Couldn't simulate physics
- Nolan went on to found Atari

## Pong

Date 1972  
Dev: Al Alcorn  
Platform: Arcade (Discrete Logic)  
Origin: USA  

Alcorn was asked to do a task and he did it well. There was some controversy around whether or not this was the first tennis game.

### Table TEnnis (1972), Ralph Bear

Nolan ripped off this idea telling Alcorn to make pong. Neither were actually the original...

### Back to Pong

- Ball changes direction from bounce, no actual physics
- Early design meant for multiplayer; the dials were specifically close to each other
- Atari team: Ted Dabrey, Nolan Bushnell, Fred Marineic, Al Alcorn
- BUshnell learned from computer space that you need to make a game that already feels familiar, not futuristic
- No one had played games except researchers

### Why Pong

- Early example of a successful industrial design for games
- Understanding that extreme simplicity was needed to bring people on board
- First successful arcade game (extremely)
  - Put in bar (Andy kass?)
  - Game is there less than a week and the nbreaks
  - The issue was that there were too many quarters in the machine and they were interfering with machinery
- Proved one could make money off video games, computer space was just a mistake
- Descended from a computer (but not a computer)

## Breakout (1976), Bushnell, Wozniak, Jobs

Had a very controversial story, but it was the first Wozniak/Jobs relation! This game eventually led to Space Invaders

## Space Invaders

Date: 1978  
Dev: Tomohiro Nishikado  
Platform: Arcade (Computer)  
Origin: Japan  

- First time seeing Japanese arcade game
- Video game industry very international
- Nishikado designed actual clips to run game (PCB) and art design; all himself
- Game development/creation with electrical engineering no longer necessary

### Speed Race (1974), Nishikado

A Road Runner clone, but not an electro-mechanical game. Also no cpu

### Gun Fight (1975), Nishikado

This was the first time people on screen seen shooting each othe. Made right before space invaders and ported by David Nutting

### Sea Wolf (1976), David Nutting

Learned to make from porting gun fight. Explosion is lights projected on to screen, and it's also a clone of periscope. This is the game that gave Nishikado the idea for Space Invaders

### Back to Space Invaders

- Used tricks fro melectromechanical age to make it have some depth; thematic hook/punch
- Sountrack is totally ripped off of Jaws theme, and this fact is even admitted by Nishikado
- The reason why creatures speed up from teh CPU is because when each one is killed there are more cycles to draw the other ones, thus getting faster and faster
- If pong showed that video games were possible, space invaders showed video games could be colossal successes
- Video game 'addiction' language from pinball

## Why Space Invaders

- Has direct relatives on the computer side and on the electromechanical game
- Uses an actual computer
  - Wy games can ramp up in complexity; games can barely keep up with cpu tech increase
- Allowing high scores; preserves scores between session (writes them to memory) making it competetive
- First colossally successful video game
  - Succking up certain coins, but even one of the most fruitful commercial products
- Evolution from a variety of lines (Sea Wolf, break out, Pinball, etc)
  - All comes back to convergence!

## Mechanics of Action Games

- Avatar Based
  - Controlling an object moving through space; not first person
- Positional
  - Tracking objects through space
- AI controlled enemies
  - PacMan great idea supporting this
  - Things push back at player
- Dexterity and reflex intensive
  - Not hard to figure out, but manipulating the machine became harder
- Linear difficulty progression
- Some stuck around, some changes, but they have so many of the same features as pinball; this is why pinball is considered the 'missing link'

## Centipede

Date: 1981  
Dev: Dona Bailey and Ed Logg  
Platform: Arcade  
Origin: USA  

- Ed Logg; super breakout, asteroids, centiped
  - Well known designer at Atari
- Asteroids went back to vector display
- Dona Bailey; centipede, millipede
  - Programmer for General Motors, thought Space Invaders was super fun
  - Accepted to atari; one of the most important people in action game development
- Given book with rejected ideas, and found a very vague description of centipede et voila!

## Why Centipede

- The first great shoot-em-up
  - Goes on to influence FPS games
- Each enemy has different AI that affects gameplay in a deep way
- Dynamics create emergent strategies where 'optimal' play is not easy to find
  - Not simple to figure out, but strategies are important!
- A rare action game solely by a woman
- Space Invaders had cpu power for only one bullet at a time, but this game had power for (at least) three
- The centepede trackball; analog controle, allows for high level of finesse
  - Helped design game around player having lots of control

## Atari VCS (1977)

From primarily playing in arcades, but now home console introduces. Most games at ports, but they were quite terrible, limited by technology.

## Great Crash of 1983

- Happens specifically in west (mostly US, little Europe)
- Market glut
  - You could just make games, no asking permission; made it hard for consumers to find diamonds in the rough
- Lack of publishing control
  - More games is better because then more consoles, right!1/??1/!!?1
- Competition from home computers
  - Upper mid class families

### E.T. (1982), Howard Scott Warsaw

Warsaw was given 6 months to make a game to go along with the movie but he knew nothing about the movie. All the carts were buried in New Mexico, and this ended up beign a final straw for the (western) video game market

## NES (FAMICOM)

- Came in during western collapse
- Better clones of arcade games
  - Able to more accurately emulate games

## Console Generation

- Atari still thrives, but lives with arcades
- NES creates new default environment
- Nintendo created a seal of approval to convince parents, but also leads to "closed garden" of the app/game story

## The Platformer

- Most popular game on consoles
- New genre
- Comes out of nowhere, no anteecdents

### Donkey Kong (1981), Shigeru Miyamoto

Followed by Mario Bros in 1983; arcade game

### Miner 2049er (1982), Bill Hogue

Perhaps an antecedent to platformers, but not quite netirely

### Manic Miner (1983), Matt Smith

Some would say this was the first platformer, and it was a computer game- not an arcade game. The soundtrack is liek Hollow of the MOuntain Something (????)

### Independent Revolution

Lots of people come up with similar design for platformers at the same time

### Super Mario Bros (1985), Shigeru Miyamoto

This game crystallized the platformer genre

## Miyamoto

- Started as an industrial designer
- Dad was friends with President of Nintendo
- He and WIll Wright are the only ones with two key games

## Super Mario Bros 3

Date: 1988  
Dev: Shigeru Miyamoto  
Platform: Famicom (NES)  
Origin: Japan  

- Seems much more advanced
- First AAA game (at least, as we think about them today)
- Lots of pressure to follow up colossal success of super mario bros
- Legacy started by these games
  - Stages
  - 3 lives, 0 means game over
  - Scoring system
  - Dexterity and reflexes
- Innovation
  - Non-linear stage order
  - Balanced for accessibility
  - Designed for long first run, discerning content
  - Designed for repeat play; warps, secrets, etc.
  - Massive length and complexity
  - Success of SMB 3 let to platformers being the big genre in the 80s

## Super Mario 64

Date: 1996  
Dev: Shigeru Miyamoto w/ Nintendo EAT  
Platform: Nintendo 64  
Origin: Japan  

- 1996 was the main shift from arcade to home
- After Quake and Doom, porting platformer into 3D world
- Technical innovations analog stick on controller
  - Allows fine tune curvs and control over the avatar; not possible with gitial input
- Not a programmatic camera; allowed some designers to control components of it
- Huge man, non-linear
- Legacy
  - Dexterity and reflexes
- Innovations
  - Analog control in 3D
  - No major loss of progress

### Fade to Black (1995), Paul Cuisset

The camera isn't great, and thus the movement kinda sucks.

## Nekketsu Koha Kunio-Kun

Date: 1986  
Dev: Yoshihisa Kishimoto w/ Techos Japan  
Platform: Arcade  
Origin: Japan  

Multiple vectors of movement. Had several similar games.

- Double Dragon (kishimoto et all)
  - Similar to above game
- River City Ransom
- Final Fight
  - Street fighter emerges from this
  - Vs multiplayer
  - CAPCOM really good at arcade side scrolling brawlers
- Devil May Cry
  - More serious
- Batman: Arkham Asylum
  - Still a 'child' of Kunio Kun

## Why Kunio-Kun

- Beginning of Brawler Genre
- Moves away from mechanical abstraction and toward simulation
- The foregunner of modern action games

## Super Hexagon

Date: 2012  
Dev: Terry Cavanaugh  
Platform: iPhone  
Origin: England  

This is the guy beind VVVVV and Dicey Dungeons; indepedent developer

## Why Super Hexagon

- Action game design has been driven foward by technology
  - Microprocessor, analog stick, etc.
- Also driven forward by artistic movements and trends
- Demonstrates the 'engineering fallacy'
  - Essentially, it's not reliant on large technology advancements
- Pop culture follows it
- Shooter with shooter taken out
- Still (basically) road runner
  - Remember the horizontal representation
- App Store / mobile market was a large part of its success
- Canonbolt (????) precursor
- Not straightforward to udnerstand it
  - Shows games are fundamentally aesthetic form and connect to the past
