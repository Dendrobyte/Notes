- Originally just 'Maze'

## Wolfenstein 3D / Wolf 3D

Date: 1992  
Dev: id Software

  - Maze War (1973) to W3D (1992) to Nvidia / Radeon (20XX)

## Doom

Date: 1993  
Dev: id Software  
Platform: MS-DOS (PC)  
Origin: USA  

- Sort of a sequel to Wolfenstein 3D
- Very gothic theme
- Swept through everyone in gaming world
- No shooting immediately in its first level
  - More about exploring space (shadows, etc) than shooting

## Why Doom

- FTP and shareware virality; allowed a free demo to be shared before buying
- Popularized multiplayer Deathmatch
- Hosting servers crashed university networks
- Played via phone lines (early internet)
- Doom amplifies muiltiplayer deathmatch
- FIrst game mod community (WAD; **W**here's **A**ll the **D**ata)
- Invention of the Game Engine
  - Game data and game engine were separate
- WADs were often illegal
- Lighting, verticality, spatial immersion
  - Wolfenstein 3D couldn't provide atmosphere, floor was just gray

## Perspective in FPS Games

- Who are you?
- Are you "there"?
- How "immersed" are you?
  - Facial expressions to think about inhabiting character
- What does it mean to be "me"?
  - Being the character, or lookign at the character
- FPS perspective captures sesnation of moving around
- It questions how we see through someone else's eyes
  - Question dates back to Renaissance (art)
  - Are you really there?

## Violence in FPS Games (1993 - 1999)

- Columbine (1999)
  - Both quoted Doom in their video manifesto
  - Actually made levels and WADs
  - Saying Doom was responsible
- Should violent games be regulated? (2201)
  - Joseph Lieberman argued it should not be given to those who are young and thus impressionable
- Brown vs. ESA (2011)
  - Ruled against (7 - 2) gov't restriction of games
  - Games were a form of free speech
  - US gov't decided games are art (essentially)
- Who are you? "A mass murderer, that's who you are"
- Immersed? "Shooting things feels great"
- Games make us feel things, and those don't have to be only positive things
- Many compare video games to 'gun culture' in US
  - Do games still contribute to society?
- As designers, think how games have an effect on the player
- Guns art is fairly costly and worth a lot ofr 3D artists
- Video games using real guns license guns from real places

## CounterStrike (1.6)

Date: 1999  
Dev: Minh Le, Jess Cliffe  
Platform: PC  
Origin: Canada  

Originally started out as a mod for half-life, based on terrorists vs. counter-terrorists

## Why CS

- Lots of famous and influential level design
  - Iconic map "De Dust"
  - Codifies level-design concepts we take for granted
- Buying guns in pause menu; pause menu and money was very innovative
- More strategy
- Ancestor of military realism and battle royale (both feel and look)
- Gun inventory, brutal learning curve, frequent sudden death, shameful post-death spectator mode
- Ballistic mechanics

## Narrative in FPS Games (1998 - 2007)

- Relates back to perspective
- Who are we in the world?

## Half-Life

Date: 1998  
Dev: Valve Software  
Platform: PC  
Origin: USA  

- Only on PC in 1998
- Very converned with story
- Crowbar is interesting due to __investment in realism__
- Very in-depth narrative introduction at the start
  - World building; it's literally just getting to work
- Iconic because of ability to explore-in-place
  - Set you in space, no combat yet

## Why Half-Life

- Level design w/ realism & scripted drama
  - There were no points of cut scenes or anything; first instance of scripted drama
- First person dogma (no camera, no cutscenes)
- Never taken out of body

## Portal

Date: 2007  
Dev: Valve Software  
Platform: PC, XBOX 360, PS3  
Origin: USA (WA, Seattle)  

- Last FPS that changed the industry
- Introduction to mechanic off the bat
- Important also for puzzle games
- gLaDoS as a narrator

## Why Portal

- Last truly original AAA SP FPS
- About space and story, not graphics or killing
  - Very good use of, and logical reasoning about, the space

## Multiplayer in FPS Games (1997 - 2007)

## Goldeneye 007

Date: 1997  
Dev: Rare  
Platform: Nintendo 64  
Origin: UK  

Rare is one of few (only exception) devs outside of North America for FPS games

## Why Goldeneye

- Terrible controls, movie tie-in, so why is it good?
- It blew up because people were able to play it together in an amazing environment
- Controller scheme for two controllers available
- 4-player split screen in 1997, like Doom in 1993
- Configuring of gamemodes
  - Very reliant/beneficial to have an amazing local multiplayer environment
  - All despite extreme controlling/movement difficulty and bad game design (inherently)

## Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2007)

Date: 2007  
Dev: Infinity Ward  
Platform: XBOX 360, PS3  
Origin: USA  

## Why COD

- Lots of combinations
  - HL drama + CS militarism
- Locked into drama
- Campaign thrown right into it; the "HL thing"
  - Akin to a movie opening
- Also included goldeneye's chaotic multiplayer nonsense
- Dorm room vibe, game brand synergy
- Ambience/sounds/vibes counteracts the whole militaristic setting
  - It's an excuse to hang out
  - Extension of multiplayer culture started by goldeneye
- Window int othe game indsustry
  - Brand machinery
  - IP by Activision, then employed about 10 other companies that swap releases each year
  - Makes games less of an artistic practice and more of an industrial practice
- Last (?) prestigious and innovative FPS that did "everything"
  - Tech, perspective, guns, multiplayer, etc.

## What's Next? (2007 - ????)

- AAA studios tried FPS-RPGS ("SIMS")
- First wave (1998, 2000)
  - Thief, Deux Ex
- Second wave (2007, 2012)
  - BioShock, Dishonored
- FPS-RPGS still interesting but not profitable
- FP/~~S~~ vs ~~FP~~/S
  - Minecraft vs Fortnite
  - Directional fork (adventure vs combat)

## Culture Industry (2016 - Present)

## Overwatch

Date: 2016  
Dev: Blizzard  
Platform: PC, XBOX 1, PS4  
Origin: USA  

- Very different artistic vibe
- eSports spectacle
- Culture as an industry
- Design isn't most important thing, it's about Overwatch as a cultural phenomenon (i.e. fans can change skin designs)
  - Heavily about fandom and metagame; monetization
- Don't have to play the game to be a part of it, such as figurines and art
- Makes it so Blizzard doesn't have to worry much about grpahcis, etc.

## GAAS (Games as a Service)

The old model was launching a game once and then profiting from the Long Tail

The new model has become launching a game many time with several updates, thus forming a "Spiky" Long Tail

## Is Fortnite an FPS

Who cares; it makes money

- To many industries, game is less of an art form and more of a money maker
- eSports leagues, gambling, microtransactions, DLC, etc.
- FPS is a business model

## Review

- Technology; Tied to what was available and pushing boundaries
- Perspective and Embodiment; Who we are and our interactions
- Violence Industry; Literal real life ties, asks us to imagine enjoy shooting a gun
- Narrative Identity; What stories do we tell, why are particular elements included, what is open-ended
- Multiplayer Mood; Imagine you are a character vs you are in the game (Self-sinertion), new social contexts
- Culture Industry; "Weaponized Multiplayer" industry, bonding over licensed proeprty
- FPS/Games are now about hte industry, the community

Golden Age fpr FPS (1993 - 2007); mostly USA [UK - Goldeneye, Canada- CS]

Maze as a first walking sim
