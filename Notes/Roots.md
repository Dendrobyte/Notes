"Playing games, but playing them with meaning"

## Key Concepts

- Games are incredibly old
- Relationship between theme and mechanics in games
  - Only seems contemporary
- Ancient games still part of pop culture
- "depth", "elegance", and "state spaces"
- Games adapt to different cultures
- 4 world games

## Knucklebones

Date: 5000 BCE  
Dev: Unknown  
Platform: Dice Game  
Origin: Unknown  

- Just spreads through culture
- Originated by using the knucklebones of goat and sheep
  - These are incredibly old, it's as early as you get

### When did humans start playing

- We can recognize things playing instantaneously
- 1.8 million years ago - Homo ergaster
  - Homo ergaster - Very early form of human (using tools)
- 300,000 years ago - Burial Rituals
  - Sudden concepts of afterlife and metaphysics, not just animal
- 200,000 years ago - Homo sapiens
- 150,000 years ago - clothing, jewelry, _complex speech_
  - Coordination through speech
- Despite this, playing is an animal trait and thus predates culture. A deeply ancient thing that has lasted. A connection we have with the ancient past- a shared history.

## Senet

Date: 3100 BCE  
Dev: Unknown  
Platform: Board Game  
Origin: Ancient Egypt  

### Why Senet

- It was a "racing game"
- Guessing from other games, like the Royal Game of Ur
- Very slick industrial design (UX)
- We know it was popular- it was played by both peasants and royalty
- Ancient egypt- first evidence of trash talk over senet
- We look at it because it's old, but also because of theme and mechanics
  - Likely started as very abstract (an abstract)
  - With growth in cultural importance, grew details
    - House of Netting- Trial for egyptian afterlife (Square 16)
    - House of Rejuvenation- Pitstop to afterlife (Square 26)
- Some terminology
  - **Mechanics:** Unit of gameplay, re-combinable actions often shared between games
  - **System:** Overall game design as a collection of mechanics and well derived set of rules
  - **Theme:** The context of a game, providing purpose to play
- Senet as a symbol for Nephrotite against afterlife0 a symbolic window to journey ni the afterlife
- We still see a theme and mechanics in Senet

## Backgammon

Date: 3000 BCE  
Dev: Unknown  
Platform: Boardgame  
Origin: Ancient Persia

### Why Backgammon

- Complicated and skill required
- Pieces off board is mechanic taken from Royal Game of Ur
- The "Table Game" from Romans
- Backgammon still played. It's an incredibly old tradition, a property of games (that they are forms of culture we have not moved on from)
- Outlasted Epic of Gilgamesh
- And it is still evolving!
- Doubling cube invented in 1920s, NYC

### Things Younger than Backgammon

America, France, French language, unification of CHina, entire Western and Eastern traditions, human inhabitation of Madagascar, use of iron (cooking or warfare), pyramids of Giza, and older tahn the domestication of the game!

## Mancala

Date: 600 CE  
Dev: Unknown  
Platform: Board Game  
Origin: Kingdom of Atsumo (Eastern Africa)  

- A family of games with similar mechanics ("sew" into "pits")
  - We play Oware, or Ayo, eslewhere called Bao (the Chess of Mancala family)

### Why Mancala

- Depth is the capacity for a game to sustain long-term (generations) of study and platform. It is a deep family of games
  - Studied, played, skill can be used, new strategies have not petered out
  - Large variety of play (never the same game twice)
- Mancala has no randomness, no hidden information
- Remarkably, not many choices per move (~6)
- Still maintains a very high level of play
- Mathematical complexity- loop/state of perpetual sewing
  - For some versions, this loop could continue for months (until someone got bored)
  - Interest outside of the game itself

## Go

Date: 400 BCE  
Dev: Unknown  
Platform: Unknown  
Origin: Ancient China  

### Why Go

- No randomness, no perfect moves
- Capturing pieces
- Stones and liberties
- **"Ko Rule":** Can't return the board to the state it was at before
- An elegant game

Elegance is a game that has

- Depth & complexity
- Simple rules that lead to very very large state space
- Linked to the ides of emergence- complexity emerges out of simple rules
- Elegance is a property found in many ancient games
  - Very few people knew how to read and write

## Chess

Date: 600 CE  
Dev: Unknown  
Platform: Boardgame  
Origin: Gupta Empire (India)  

### Why Chess

- Somewhat more modern; argued if started in Persia/IRan or China
- Unlike Backgammon and Mancala, it is a story of constant adaptation
  - Starts out as Chatarauga (queen call a bizere (adviser))
    - Bizere like king, but could 'die'
  - Shatranj, Persia (first stop before it goes to Europe)
    - Pieces become abstract, chess moves away from tiny forms
  - Xianqi, China
    - Can be traced to there as well
  - Shogi, Japan (Operations very differentlym but similar parts of story)
- Chess evolved/adapted as it moved
- Chess moves to Europe after Persia- game retursn to former state from abstract in Persia, despite unaware of original design
  - Chess game from Persia, chess is a deformed word of Shat(-ranj)
  - Checkmate is a derivation of Shamat(king is dead)
  - Chess has stuff, least elegant but has a rich visual history
    - Lovis CHessman, carved from Walrus tusk in Noray
    - Has lots of rules to learn; each pieces has a pattern of movement
    - CHess has a lot of children (spinoffs)
      - Most popular game of middle ages
      - There exists an unbroken line from DnD to Prussian War Games, to Chess
    - Deeply adaptable and people want to adapt it

## Why these games

They are still played today. You can go anywhere on earth and find people who play these games

They are living culture, not just something we share with the past but with everyone on the planet in the present
