It will be the duration of class- an hour and a half.

### The final

- It will be happening in this room, Dec 16th
- Same room, on the first Monday of finals week, at **6 PM to 8 PM**

## Into the games! - Lecturer: Frank Lantz

Little Wars by H.G. Wells

- In 1913, was the origin of the strategy genre. It was the "first" tabletop strategy game of sorts.
- In this book, we see lots of features that are standard aspects of strategy games. hidden info, drama of moves, etc.

## Key Concepts

- War as a subject
- Decision-making under uncertainty
  - Uncertainty as a key ingredient of game design)
- Thinking as experience - the "Cerebral" domain
  - Some games themselves are about the cerebral aspect of decision-making and how strategy games embody that
- Time as a game design parameter - turn-based vs. real-time
- Macro vs Micro
- The importance of interface and control schemes
- The evolution of strategy games from Chess to e-Sports

### Kriegspiel ("War Game")

Date: 1812  
Developer: George Leopold von Reiswitz  
Platform: Board game  
Region of origin: Prussia  

- Evolved out of prussian military school
- Essentially a mod of chess. Started out as a game you would play using mulitple chest boards, combining them to create a more complex and expansive version
- Part of the ongoing variants of chess. Still a variant you can play by putting two chess boards together
- It qualifies as a simulation of combat, as its own standalone game and having different and unique materials.
- Had its roots in the study of war by people who were in military schools/academies, training to become generals, etc. that saw the value of board games and wanted to expand them in order for them to be more specific.
  - Making them more closely aligned with specific problem solving when managing troops in battle or something similar. You have all these aspects, such as terrain, and then extra rules including things like range, etc.
- A management of information; You don't know your opponents moves until a unit could see opponent's pieces. It was one of the main shifts from chess- _in addition to adding more stuff, there is the idea of careful information management_
- A "serious" game. Meant for serious usage, and played as an intellectual exercise in cognitive problem solving. The basic idea was to embody the necessary parts of cognitive problem solving one would need as a general. It was extremely popular, but its efficacy isn't really known.

#### Why Kriegspiel

- It was the first "war game"
- First example of detailed combat simlulation
  - First clear example of this
- The roots of D&D (and therefore an important influence on much of modern games)
  - D&D emerged directly from tabletop combat simulations

### Little Wars

- More playful. About harnessing the simulations of war. It brought from Kriegspiel the attention to detail. Indulging in the pleasure of simulation was a large part of the aesthetic of Little Wars.
- Under the hood, Kriegspiel and Little Wars share their components with games like Go and Chess, but they bring so much more to the aesthetic of miniature simulation.
- Why do we care about indulging ourselves in this elaborate simulation of perhaps what is the worst thing we can do? Why is indulging in war so attractive?
  - War was present to those in Europe as a culture of life that was fascinating and vivid
  - In the theme of it, there is a lot of thinking and, well, strategy involved. Lots of complications that lend themselves to interesting problem solving.
  - It has a win condition. _It has discrete outcomes._
  - In our culture, there is a certain status for military action. Although it varies

### Fog of War

- Carl von Clausewitz. Prussian Military.
- The _Fog of War_ is a concept he coined. Quote on slides.
- The fog of war is that we don't know for sure on the right decision. We are in a darkness of information to make crucial decisions.
- In game design, fog of war is the management of hidden information. This marked the difference between chess and Kriegspiel.
- The situation is uncertain, but it doesn't truly matter. We drift through the ambiguity of life, but in the heat of battle the uncertainty is incredibly relevant to you and just how much it matters.
  - Coming up with the best maneuver and making the right decision becomes an intensely present issue
  - It can also be a sublime experience; There are some who go through combat and realize there were some aspects of it that were profoundly moving to them in that moment.
- One way to understand this as a theme to explore within games is as a sort of alchemy. Perhaps we can extract some good and valuable things from the horrible reality that is war.
  - Strategies
  - Digging deep
  - Persevering through difficult and challenging problems
  - Being able to attempt to come to the correct outcome

### Representation of War

- Strategy games, at the top
  - High leven plans
  - Long term predictions
  - General principles
  - Abstract logic
  - "Attack where the enemy is weakest" (PLaying things smart)
- Tactics, lower down to reality
  - Short-term predictions
  - Concrete turn-by-turn calculations
  - "Move the archers back" (Specifics of how you'll maneuver)
- Action, more to the immediate experience
  - Immediate, in-the-moment execution
  - Skill
  - "Don't shoot until you see the whites of their eyes!" (Moment execution)
- Strategy and tactic bullets are what we are considering in the world of the Strategy Game genre
- The core ingredients pf strategy gameswe are worrying about are
  - COnscious
  - Deliberate
  - "Cerebral"
- In action games, things are more
  - Subsconscious
  - Automatic
  - Instinctive
- Three ways to win a game
  - Luck
    - being
    - fate determining who will win
  - Actions
    - doint
    - skill determining who will win
  - Strategy
    - thinking
    - (deeper) intelligence determining who will win
- While COD might require intelligence and brain training, it isn't particularly "cerebral"
- The conscious deliberate choices (who goes where, etc.) is what we think of for "cerebral"
- Strategy as an ingredient in games
  - Conscious deliberate choices
  - Claculation
  - Planning and prediction
  - Cerbral style
- Strategy as a game genre
  - Competitive decision making
  - (Often) military simulations
  - Top-down general's eye view
  - Abstraction, systems, rules

### M.U.L.E. -

Date: 1983  
Developer: Danielle Bunten Berry w/ Ozard Softscape
Platform: Atari 400/800
Region of origin: USA

- Players are playing on an alien planet and fighting over spots of land for resources which they can sell.
- _It is a resource management and economics game_
- It's a board game on steroids
- Innovative and ahead of its time.
  - It's not mecessarily focused on military combat but more economic combat.
- The heart of the game is where you trade resources with other players. It is an incredibly clever way of live real time trading.
  - Top of the screen sell, bottom of the screen buy. The vertical location is the price, i.e. the players walk up/down to change the price they're willing to buy/sell at.
  - Part of this strategy is sort of like faking someone out, and this movement system can help you show intentions. A visualization of this market game.
- Some inspiration taken from Monopoly

#### Why M.U.L.E. -

- Deeply respected and influential among game designers
- Advanced ideas - far ahead of it's time
  - Economic conflict
  - Deep multiplayer interaction
  - Real-time auction mechanic (people stil think of it as a very clever mechanic)

### Civilization (Series)

Date: 1991 - present
Developer: Sid Meier w/ MicroProse
Platform: PC
Region of Origin: USA

- Civ is based on a specific board game that Meier took as inspiration. A bunch of different designers had considered making a game out of it.
- 4X Games
  - Explore
  - Expand
  - Exploit
  - Exterminate ðŸ˜Ÿ
- A simulation of a country/nation starting out as a single location. It then expands and grows to occupy the entire map.
  - It also evolves over time to become more and more sophisticated in time. You move through historical eras
- One of the first games to introduce a _multimodal interface_
  - Multiple windows to do different parts of the game
- A sophisticated diplomatic system, where you have to negotiate with various players.
  - Negotiating diplomatically was just as important, if not more important, than just war
- Deep, detailed, complex, layered ruleset
- Multiple paths to victory
  - Instead of defeating your enemy by destroying them, you can build 'Wonders' to win peacefully
  - You still need to think about military if you're going for this, though
- Tech tree
  - When your nation starts out, it has a set of simple technologies that are game mechanics.
    - They are the ways which you can itneract with the board
    - What type of structures you can build and units you can order, etc.
  - Evolving these technologies over time
  - Choosing which technologies and branches to go down
  - The decisions you make early on continue to unfold. Once you continue going down a certain path it determines the rest of the course of that path
  - A way to embody the idea that decisions you make early on in the game resonate down through the game
  - _It manifests the idea that decisions matter._ Your choices and decisions will continue to reverberate down many hours of play. The decisions will remain to be important and continue to have influence over the rest of the game.
- _"A game is a series of interesting decisions."_ **- Sid Meier**
  - Very narrow though, for example we can also say games that are more about experience and less about player agency
- Player choice is the core aspect of Civ. It is about making the player's choices matter- what makes their choices _interesting_
  - What makes a choice meaningful? What makes a game not boring?
- An interesting question whilst you play Civ V: Why is this game referred to as among the best video games of all time?
  - Partly about the theme. In a hobby dominated by vulgar or silly thematic (not always, but often), Civ has a sober presentation- a more sophisticated theme. It's grounded in a sense of realism, and not abstract.
  - The depth of the systems- i.e. the tech tree, complex interlocking rules- is important.
  - Idea of exponential growth; start small and get big. It's just a good/fun feeling
  - It has a steady rhythm of making moves and seeing hte outcome of those moves in such a way that is always overlapping

#### Why Civilization

- Widely considered one of the greatest games of all time
- SOphisitcated theme
- Deeply compelling single-player game ("one more turn!")
- Highly influential (i.e. tech trees)

### X-COM (series)

Date 1993 - Present  
Developer: Julian Gollop w/ MicroProse  
Platform: PC  
Region of origin: England

- Pointed to as one of the greatest games of all time
- Turn-based, tactical battles. You control humans who are fighting back against invading aliens within a larger, global strategy game
- There is a large scope
  - Overall grand scope like base-building and adding specific rooms to your base for the kinds of technology you can develop
  - Also recruiting individual fighters to join the force, but their persistence over time adds to the game
- The units are simply like chess pieces; very simple and abstract. Yet, you give them a name and in that persistence of the chess pieces where over time, they get experience that makes them feel like real people
  - They might be just chess pieces- no dialogue, stories, etc.- but they somehow manage to feel like little characters
  - It is conjured by the mechanics of the game. The story the player makes up is a consequence of the mechanics, not of a backstory within the game
  - This concept is a good example of an emergent narrative
- Fog of war - You can't see what's out in the darkness (it's a bunch of aliens)

#### Why X-COM

- Beloved example of deep gameplay
  - Representing really crunchy, deep gameplay
- Two-teired experience/structure; Tactical and Strategic levels
  - Base building and battle
- Powerful example of emergent emotional attachment
  - Given the right framing structures, stories can percolate up

### Fire Emblem (Series)

Date: 1990 - Present  
Developer: Intelligent Systems  
Platform: Famicom (NES)  
Region of origin: Japan  

- Animation was top-tier, especially in binding blade
- There was the design goal that encapsulates the strategy game aesthetic but apply to a much broader audience
- Intersection of a composed narrative and tactical gameplay

#### Why Fire Emblem

- Accessible _and_ deep
- One of the all-time great turn-based tactics games
  - Up there with 'Advanced Wars' (game out the 9/10/11)
- Successful blend of strategy and storytelling
- Modular story and character death

### Quick Aside: Game Theory

- Game theory game out of strategy games, deeply related
- It's the logic of interacting choices
  - Comes out of mathematics and economics
- A mathematical analysis of decision-making
- Developed by studying poker and other games
- Influential in economics, political science, and biology (!)

Soemthing is up? Time is up!

### Populous

Date: 1989  
Developer: Peter Molyneux w/ Bullfrog Productions  
Platform: PC, Amiga  
Region of origin: England  

- Started out as an experiment with a little terrain generator, a toy-like thing where you could move people around and change the little world
- Built a little game around this activity- this little isometric engine he made- designing a game where you were essentially a god over the little world where the people were worshipping you.
  - More worship led to more power
- There are later enemy tribes, and all these various sorts of mechanics
- _The whole thing unfolds in real time._ One of the first examples with strategic decision making, unfolding in real-time

#### Why Populous

- Great example of Molyneux' genius
  - Had important status in game design. He made a lot of games- many good, many terrible
- First "god game"
  - All these strategy games imply some sort of god-like perspective, and in this one it literally makes you that 'god'
- Early real-time strategy (RTS)
- Isometric 3D terrain

### Other early RTS games

- Herzog Zwei, 1989
  - Often referred to as a precursor to current RTS games
  - You're flying around and commanding different units
- Dune 2, 1992
  - Considered _the_ first official RTS game. It sets down the blueprint for what is now considered to be RTS
  - Autonomous units with controls, context sensitive mouse commands, sophisticated modal structure, fog of war, tech trees, etc.

### Common Features (the hallmarks) of Real-Time Strategy

- Resource Management
- Base Building
- Tech-trees
  - Making mutually exclusive decisions that affect what happens down the road
- Indirect control / semi-autonomous units
  - Pathfinding or own types of behavior
- COntext-sensitive cursor-based controls

### Brett Sperry

- Westwood Studios
- Dune II, Command & Conquer
- Sort of invented RTS but not very popular. This really came out of an individual.
- The inspiration from Dune II was partially from Populous, but also from the Mac OS (interface within games, away with hotkeys)
- Chuck thought war games sucked due to lack of innovation and design, but Brett took it to the next level with RTS

### RTS in the 90s (Westwood / Blizzard Rivalry)

- Command & Conquer (Westwood)
- Warcraft (Blizzard)

### Starcraft (Series)

Date: 1998 - present  
Developer: Blizzard Entertainment  
Platform: PC  
Region of origin: USA  

- Comes out of this active period of competition
- Started with Warcraft/Warcraft II engine, but with a cosmetic difference
- The key ingredient to Starcraft was thinking about three different sides that all play intensely differently
  - **A strong commitment to asymmetry**
  - Each one (3 diff) has different tech trees, units, etc.
  - Each side had characteristic match ups against the other two or players playing the same side
  - All combined to lead to a rich strategic experience
- All these games were competitive and played against each other, _but Starcraft was the first game to get a serious, high level competitive game scene._
  - Similar to the relationship of chess, go, tennis, etc. Getting good at Starcraft could become a full-time application
- **Eventually led to the development of contemporary e-Sports** - South Korea = ground zero
  - Korean commitment to broadband culture
  - Needed PC games (not Japanese arcade games)
  - There already was a culture of serious, professional, competitive strategy game playing (i.e. Go)
- Starcraft has openings that you study, like in chess
- There is a very important between micro and macro
  - **Micro:** What you are doing when controlling individual units
  - **Macro:** What you are oding when you are doing base building, tech-trees, etc.
  - You have to balance both very carefully in Starcraft because it is entirely both of them
- APM = Actions per Minute
  - A little technical skill of moving hands around fast enough
- In Starcraft II, each of the 3 races has a special unit
  - The terren special limit is called the Mule (a direct reference!)

#### Why Starcraft

- Greatest RTS game of all time
- Macro/Micro balance - Deep strategy and high skill simultaneously
- Pioneering ESport
- Global cultural impact

### League of Legends

Date: 2009 (Released today, Oct 15th, 10 years ago!)  
Developer: Riot Games  
Platform: PC  
Region of Origin: USA  

- A 5v5 real-time strategy game
- Started out as a mod of Warcraft III
- Some games are the individual works of authors, this game came out of the community in _Battle.net_ and to Blizzard's commitment to open process
  - Blizzard would ship a game and tools to mod and work on this game.
  - Tower defense as a genre came out of this process of modifying and tinkering and sharing of ideas and collaboration
- Now the most dominant eSport
- Defense of the Ancients (DOTA)
- Sort of a mixture of chess, basketball, and Pokemon
  - Chess from tabletop
  - Basketball team-based
  - Pokemon from its deep complexity
- Even though you are controlling individual units, you can trace back some details to tabletop history and working with essences of military conflicts
- The team-based aspect is a really important aspect of this game
  - The intricacies of coordinating actions amongst an entire team happens in real time and takes deep skill
  - Deliberate, conscious decision-making involved, but also immediate skill at various points
- The game is so hard to play, memorizing items and units is easy in contrast
- The strategic came play is the core connection with the rest of the games in this lecture

#### Why League of Legends

- Biggest, most popular video game in the world?
- Complex, deep, difficult, challenging, and beautiful!
  - For the first many hours, there is struggling and losting to learn in order to understand the intracacies of the games; akin to the mind of Shakespeare
- Team-based strategy game
- Most advanced expession of real-time "Action RPG" combat
  - Often involves tank, dps, healer, crowd control, etc.
- The legacy of Kriegspiel continues to evolve (full circle!)
  
_Note to self: Maybe playing strategy games will help you make decisions when there is a darkness of information... Like if someone really likes you back or not and what the right decision is! It's all about not knowing._

- Fire Emblem (!)
- Civ V
