## Frequencies et al

- _Cumulative Frequency = CF_ - Sums the frequencies at and below a particular value
- _Relative frequency and cumulative relative frequency_
  - RF = $\frac{f}{N}$
  - CRF = $\frac{cf}{N}$
- _Cumulative Percentage Frequency = CPF = CRF x 100_
- Real limits are half a unit above and half a unit below
- _Frequency Polygon_ is polygon from tops of histogram bars
- _Cumulative frequency polygon_ - Dots are above real limits for that value (remember what cf represents), always increasing ('s' shape)
- _Grouped frequency distribution_ - Apparent vs real limits
  - Num of intervals = range / interval width
    - Interval width usually between 10 or 20
  - Calculate real limits, show apparent limits
  - Can have f, cf, rf, crf table for this also

## Distribution information

- When characterizing a distribution of numbers...
  - Center of distribution
  - Spread of distribution - How far scores are spread out
  - Shape of distribution
- Spread tells you how good, or how accurate, the center is
- Measures of central tendency
  - Mean
  - Median
  - Mode
- Average does not always indicate mean
  - Mean does not always indicate the center
- Mean is _always affected by outliers!_
- Median == 50th percentile == 2nd quartile (Q2)
  - Median is _not_ affected by outliers
  - Used for open-ended categories and undeterminable score
- Measures of spread/dispersion - How far scores are spread out
  - Range
    - _is_ affected by outliers
  - SIQR (semi interquartile range)
    - half the numerical distance between Q1 and Q3)
    - _not_ affected by outliers
  - SS (sum of squares)
    - Square deviation scores, add them up
    - How far a score is from the mean (deviation scores)
    - Without squaring, deviation scores add to zero **(zero sum principle)**
  - Variance
    - Represented by $\sigma$
    - Also called Mean Square, or MS
  - Standard deviation - A measure of variability in the original units of whatever is being measured
  - Definition formula
    - Tells you the definition of what you are doing
    - Population and sample
  - Use the computation formulas!
- **Greek letters are _only_ for population parameters**
- Dividing by $n$, in terms of samples, is bias. It is systematically less than it should be
  - Solution: Use $n-1$ _(degrees of freedom)
- Mean Square = MS - Another name for variance
- _Degrees of Freedom (df)_
  - Number of scores that are free to vary in a distribution
  - The number of separate pieces of information that you have about variability
  - If you add up the scores, the last one (or last few) cannot vary because it has to add up to zero
  - **It is _not always_ $n-1$**
- Skewed distributions
  - Positive skew
  - Negative skew
  - Be careful about 'median income'
  - Skews are important because of limitations
- The floor effect is essentially a 'bottom boundary', and ceiling is a 'top boundary'
