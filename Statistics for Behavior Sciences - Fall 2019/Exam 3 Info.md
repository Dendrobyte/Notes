## Computation

- [ ] One correlation
  - [ ] r
  - [ ] hypothesis
  - [ ] test for significance
  - [ ] interpretation of results
- [ ] One regression: slope, intercept, equation, coefficient of determination (and interpretation), variance of the estimate (and interpretation), coefficient of nondetermination (and interpretation), if given X what would you predict Y to be?
  - [ ] slope

  - [ ] coefficient of nondetermination (and interpretation)
  - [ ] given X, what would you predict Y to be?
- [ ] Reading SPSS output
  - [ ] slope
  - [ ] intercept
  - [ ] correlation from regression output
- [ ] One matched-t question
  - [ ] type of design
  - [ ] hypotheses (symbols and words)
  - [ ] standard error of the difference scores
  - [ ] t-test
  - [ ] df
  - [ ] crit value
  - [ ] reject or fail to reject
  - [ ] interprtation

## Always know APA formatting

I'd imagine this means for typing up results, and remember... _don't write yourself into a wrong answer!_
